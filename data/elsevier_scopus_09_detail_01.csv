0,SCOPUS_ID:85112246017,"Background: Chagas disease (CD) and ischemic stroke (IS) have a close, but poorly understood, association. There is paucity of evidence on the ideal secondary prophylaxis and etiological determination, with few cardioembolic patients being identified. Aims: This study aimed to describe a multicenter cohort of patients with concomitant CD and IS admitted in tertiary centers and to create a predictive model for cardioembolic embolism in CD and IS. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical and regular medical records of patients with CD and IS in several academic, hospital-based, and university hospitals across Brazil. Descriptive analyses of cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic patients were performed. A prediction model for cardioembolism was proposed with 70% of the sample as the derivation sample, and the model was validated in 30% of the sample. Results: A total of 499 patients were analyzed. The median age was similar in both groups; however, patients with cardioembolic embolism were younger and tended to have higher alcoholism, smoking, and death rates. The predictive model for the etiological classification showed close relation with the number of abnormalities detected on echocardiography and electrocardiography as well as with vascular risk factors. Conclusions: Our results replicate in part those previously published, with a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors and lower median age in patients with cardioembolic etiology. Our new model for predicting cardioembolic etiology can help identify patients with higher recurrence rate and therefore allow an optimized strategy for secondary prophylaxis. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence,Cardio-aortic embolism,Chagas disease,Epidemiology,Ischemic stroke,Multicenter study"
1,SCOPUS_ID:85105887514,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global health burden. Screening for sight-threatening DR (STDR) is the first cost-effective step to decrease this burden. We analyzed the similarities and variations between the recent country-specific and the International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) DR guideline to identify gaps and suggest possible solutions for future universal screening. We selected six representative national DR guidelines, one from each World Health Organization region, including Canada (North America), England (Europe), India (South- East Asia), Kenya (Africa), New Zealand (Western Pacific), and American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern (used in Latin America and East Mediterranean). We weighed the newer camera and artificial intelligence (AI) technology against the traditional screening methodologies. All guidelines agree that screening for DR and STDR in people with diabetes is currently led by an ophthalmologist; few engage non-ophthalmologists. Significant variations exist in the screening location and referral timelines. Screening with digital fundus photography has largely replaced traditional slit-lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy. The use of mydriatic digital 2-or 4-field fundus photography is the current norm; there is increasing interest in using non-mydriatic fundus cameras. The use of automated DR grading and tele-screening is currently sparse. Country-specific guidelines are necessary to align with national priorities and human resources. International guidelines such as the ICO DR guidelines remain useful in countries where no guidelines exist. Validation studies on AI and tele-screening call for urgent policy decisions to integrate DR screening into universal health coverage to reduce this global public health burden. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.",
2,SCOPUS_ID:85116955096,"Background: Populational ageing has been increasing in a remarkable rate in developing countries. In this scenario, preventive strategies could help to decrease the burden of higher demands for healthcare services. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied for identifying priority candidates for preventive actions, presenting a better predictive performance than traditional parsimonious models. Methods: Data were collected from the Health, Well Being and Aging (SABE) Study, a representative sample of older residents of Saõ Paulo, Brazil. Machine learning algorithms were applied to predict death by diseases of respiratory system (DRS), diseases of circulatory system (DCS), neoplasms and other specific causes within 5 years, using socioeconomic, demographic and health features. The algorithms were trained in a random sample of 70% of subjects, and then tested in the other 30% unseen data. Results: The outcome with highest predictive performance was death by DRS (AUC-ROC = 0.89), followed by the other specific causes (AUC-ROC = 0.87), DCS (AUC-ROC = 0.67) and neoplasms (AUC-ROC = 0.52). Among only the 25% of individuals with the highest predicted risk of mortality from DRS were included 100% of the actual cases. The machine learning algorithms with the highest predictive performance were light gradient boosted machine and extreme gradient boosting. Conclusion: The algorithms had a high predictive performance for DRS, but lower for DCS and neoplasms. Mortality prediction with machine learning can improve clinical decisions especially regarding targeted preventive measures for older individuals. © 2021 The Author(s).

3,SCOPUS_ID:85109585981,"Background and Objective: Operating Rooms (ORs) are among the most expensive services in hospitals. A challenge to optimize the OR efficiency is to improve the surgery scheduling task, which requires the estimation of surgical time duration. Surgeons or programming units (based on people's experience) typically do the duration estimation using an experience-based strategy, which may include some bias, such as overestimating the surgery time, increasing ORs' operational cost. Methods: This paper analyzes a machine learning-based solution for surgical time predictions. We apply and compare four machine-learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Regression Trees, and Bagged Trees) to predict the surgical time duration at a tertiary referral university hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. Historical data from 2004 until 2019 was used to train the algorithms. Comparison among algorithms was given in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the predicted surgery duration and the algorithms' computing time. The algorithm with the best performance was compared to the currently used experience-based method. Results: All the ML algorithms predict the surgery duration with an error between 26 and 37 min. The best overall performance was obtained using Bagged Trees (26 min RMSE, 3.16 min training time, 0.49 min testing time) when using a subset of the DB with the nine specialties containing 80% of the surgeries. Bagged Trees also outperformed the experience-based method with a lower RMSE; however, it also shifted from a predominant overestimation to underestimating surgeries' duration. Conclusions: Different ML algorithms for predicting the surgical time duration, showing and comparing their performance. Bagged Trees showed the best performance in terms of RMSE and computing time. Depending on the initial data, Bagged Trees outperformed the experience-based method, but future work is necessary to suit it, like any other ML algorithm, to the hospitals' needs. © 2021","Assembly methods,Linear regression,Machine learning,Regression trees,Support vector machine,Surgical time prediction"
4,SCOPUS_ID:85106617575,"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a great impact on mental health in society. Considering the little attention paid by scientific studies to either students or university staff during lockdown, the current study has two aims: (a) to analyze the evolution of mental health and (b) to identify predictors of educational/professional experience and online learning/teaching expe-rience. (2) Methods: 1084 university students and 554 staff in total from four different countries (Spain, Colombia, Chile and Nicaragua) participated in the study, affiliated with nine different uni-versities, four of them Spanish and one of which was online. We used an online survey known as LockedDown, which consists of 82 items, analyzed with classical multiple regression analyses and machine learning techniques. (3) Results: Stress level and feelings of anxiety and depression of students and staff either increased or remained over the weeks. A better online learning experience for university students was associated with the age, perception of the experience as beneficial and support of the university. (4) Conclusions: The study has shown evidence of the emotional impact and quality of life for both students and staff. For students, the evolution of feelings of anxiety and de-pression, as well as the support offered by the university affected the educational experience and online learning. For staff who experienced a positive professional experience, with access to services and products, the quality-of-life levels were maintained. © 2021 by the authors.

5,SCOPUS_ID:85104657972,"Background: Periodically, humanity is often faced with new and emerging viruses that can be a significant global threat. It has already been over a century post—the Spanish Flu pandemic, and we are witnessing a new type of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for Covid-19. It emerged from the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and within a few months, the virus propagated itself globally now resulting more than 50 million cases with over 1 million deaths. The high infection rates coupled with dynamic population movement demands for tools, especially within a Brazilian context, that will support health managers to develop policies for controlling and combating the new virus. Methods: In this work, we propose a tool for real-time spatio-temporal analysis using a machine learning approach. The COVID-SGIS system brings together routinely collected health data on Covid-19 distributed across public health systems in Brazil, as well as taking to under consideration the geographic and time-dependent features of Covid-19 so as to make spatio-temporal predictions. The data are sub-divided by federative unit and municipality. In our case study, we made spatio-temporal predictions of the distribution of cases and deaths in Brazil and in each federative unit. Four regression methods were investigated: linear regression, support vector machines (polynomial kernels and RBF), multilayer perceptrons, and random forests. We use the percentage RMSE and the correlation coefficient as quality metrics. Results: For qualitative evaluation, we made spatio-temporal predictions for the period from 25 to 27 May 2020. Considering qualitatively and quantitatively the case of the State of Pernambuco and Brazil as a whole, linear regression presented the best prediction results (thematic maps with good data distribution, correlation coefficient >0.99 and RMSE (%) <4% for Pernambuco and around 5% for Brazil) with low training time: [0.00; 0.04 ms], CI 95%. Conclusion: Spatio-temporal analysis provided a broader assessment of those in the regions where the accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 were concentrated. It was possible to differentiate in the thematic maps the regions with the highest concentration of cases from the regions with low concentration and regions in the transition range. This approach is fundamental to support health managers and epidemiologists to elaborate policies and plans to control the Covid-19 pandemics. © Copyright © 2021 da Silva, de Lima, da Silva, Silva, Marques, de Araújo, Albuquerque Júnior, de Souza, de Santana, Gomes, Barbosa, Musah, Kostkova, dos Santos and da Silva Filho.","COVID-19,Covid-19 pandemics forecasting,digital epidemiology,SARS-CoV-2,spatio-temporal analysis,spatio-temporal forecasting"
6,SCOPUS_ID:85104152762,"Background: Controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil is a challenge due to the population's size and urban density, inefficient maintenance of social distancing and testing strategies, and limited availability of testing resources. Objective: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. Methods: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. Results: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. Conclusions: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy.89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

7,SCOPUS_ID:85104047429,"Background: According to the World Health Organization, achieving targets for control of leprosy by 2030 will require disease elimination and interruption of transmission at the national or regional level. India and Brazil have reported the highest leprosy burden in the last few decades, revealing the need for strategies and tools to help health professionals correctly manage and control the disease. Objective: The main objective of this study was to develop a cross-platform app for leprosy screening based on artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of increasing accessibility of an accurate method of classifying leprosy treatment for health professionals, especially for communities further away from major diagnostic centers. Toward this end, we analyzed the quality of leprosy data in Brazil on the National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). Methods: Leprosy data were extracted from the SINAN database, carefully cleaned, and used to build AI decision models based on the random forest algorithm to predict operational classification in paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy. We used Python programming language to extract and clean the data, and R programming language to train and test the AI model via cross-validation. To allow broad access, we deployed the final random forest classification model in a web app via shinyApp using data available from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System. Results: We mapped the dispersion of leprosy incidence in Brazil from 2014 to 2018, and found a particularly high number of cases in central Brazil in 2014 that further increased in 2018 in the state of Mato Grosso. For some municipalities, up to 80% of cases showed some data discrepancy. Of a total of 21,047 discrepancies detected, the most common was ""operational classification does not match the clinical form.""After data processing, we identified a total of 77,628 cases with missing data. The sensitivity and specificity of the AI model applied for the operational classification of leprosy was 93.97% and 87.09%, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed app was able to recognize patterns in leprosy cases registered in the SINAN database and to classify new patients with paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy, thereby reducing the probability of incorrect assignment by health centers. The collection and notification of data on leprosy in Brazil seem to lack specific validation to increase the quality of the data for implementations via AI. The AI models implemented in this work had satisfactory accuracy across Brazilian states and could be a complementary diagnosis tool, especially in remote areas with few specialist physicians. © 2021 Márcio Luís Moreira De Souza, Gabriel Ayres Lopes, Alexandre Castelo Branco, Jessica K Fairley, Lucia Alves De Oliveira Fraga.","Apps,Artificial intelligence,Leprosy,MHealth,Python,R,Random forest,ShinyApp"
8,SCOPUS_ID:85114197279,"Currently the high rates of university dropouts and low graduation are social problems that are very relevant in Chilean society. Predicting these events can allow institutions to take action to avoid them. The typical prediction models based on machine learning are capable of making reliable predictions, however they do not allow to understand the causality that originates both events, which could help to take better actions. This work proposes to find, analyze and weigh the causal relationships that allow predicting whether a student will drop out or will graduate according to the information available using a framework with Bayesian networks. The study is based on real data from the Universidad Católica de Temuco in Chile collected over three years.

10,SCOPUS_ID:85102574777,"Background and objective: In the current pandemic scenario, data mining tools are fundamen-tal to evaluate the measures adopted to contain the spread of COVID-19. In this study, unsupervised neural networks of the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) type were used to assess the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 in Brazil, according to the number of cases and deaths in regions, states, and cities. Materials and methods: The SOM applied in this context does not evaluate which measures applied have helped contain the spread of the disease, but these datasets represent the repercussions of the country’s measures, which were implemented to contain the virus’ spread. Results: This approach demonstrated that the spread of the disease in Brazil does not have a standard behavior, changing according to the region, state, or city. The analyses showed that cities and states in the north and northeast regions of the country were the most affected by the disease, with the highest number of cases and deaths registered per 100,000 inhabitants. Conclusions: The SOM clustering was able to spatially group cities, states, and regions according to their coronavirus cases, with similar behavior. Thus, it is possible to benefit from the use of similar strategies to deal with the virus’ spread in these cities, states, and regions. © 2021 by the authors.

11,SCOPUS_ID:85100533991,"The emergence of digital social networks has transformed society, social groups, and institutions in terms of the communication and expression of their opinions. Determining how language variations allow the detection of communities, together with the relevance of specific vocabulary (proposed by the National Council of Accreditation of Colombia (Consejo Nacional de Acreditación - CNA) to determine the quality evaluation parameters for universities in Colombia) in digital assemblages could lead to a better understanding of their dynamics and social foundations, thus resulting in better communication policies and intervention where necessary. The approach presented in this paper intends to determine what are the semantic spaces (sociolinguistic features) shared by social groups in digital social networks. It includes five layers based on Design Science Research, which are integrated with Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The approach is validated through a case study wherein the semantic values of a series of “Twitter” institutional accounts belonging to Colombian Universities are analyzed in terms of the 12 quality factors established by CNA. In addition, the topics and the sociolect used by different actors in the university communities are also analyzed. The current approach allows determining the sociolinguistic features of social groups in digital social networks. Its application allows detecting the words or concepts to which each actor of a social group (university) gives more importance in terms of vocabulary. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Community detection,Community discovery,Natural language processing,Social networks,Sociolinguistic"
12,SCOPUS_ID:85101674301,"BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic, declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, which could have negative consequences for pregnant and postpartum women. The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study. METHODS: This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period. It is being carried out in 11 European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6 months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V). DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques. The findings will help policymakers develop suitable guidelines and prevention strategies for perinatal mental health and contribute to designing tailored mental health interventions.

13,SCOPUS_ID:85081919401,"Objective: Prediction models have become frequent in the medical literature, but most published studies are conducted in a single setting. Heterogeneity between development and validation samples has been posited as a major obstacle for the generalization of models. We aimed to develop a multivariable prognostic model using sociodemographic variables easily obtainable from adolescents at age 15 to predict a depressive disorder diagnosis at age 18 and to evaluate its generalizability in 2 samples from diverse socioeconomic and cultural settings. Method: Data from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort were used to develop the prediction model, and its generalizability was evaluated in 2 representative cohort studies: the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study and the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. Results: At age 15, 2,192 adolescents with no evidence of current or previous depression were included (44.6% male). The apparent C-statistic of the models derived in Pelotas ranged from 0.76 to 0.79, and the model obtained from a penalized logistic regression was selected for subsequent external evaluation. Major discrepancies between the samples were identified, impacting the external prognostic performance of the model (Dunedin and E-Risk C-statistics of 0.63 and 0.59, respectively). The implementation of recommended strategies to account for this heterogeneity among samples improved the model's calibration in both samples. Conclusion: An adolescent depression risk score comprising easily obtainable predictors was developed with good prognostic performance in a Brazilian sample. Heterogeneity among settings was not trivial, but strategies to deal with sample diversity were identified as pivotal for providing better risk stratification across samples. Future efforts should focus on developing better methodological approaches for incorporating heterogeneity in prognostic research. © 2020 The Authors","adolescent,cohort studies,depression,prognosis,risk assessment"

In this paper, we provide an overview of how these techniques can improve nursing care, and we detail a quantitative model to afford managerial insights about care management in a Hospital in Colombia. Our main purpose is to provide tools to improve key performance indicators for the care management of inpatients which includes the nurse workload. Methods: The optimal nurse-to-patient assignment problem is addressed using analytics, lean health care, and AI. Also, we propose a new mathematical model to optimize the nurse-to-patient assignment decisions considering several variables about the patient state such as the Barthel index, their risks, the complexity of the care, and the mental state. Findings: Our results show that there are several processes inherent to compassionate nursing care that can be improved using technology. By using data analytics, we can also provide insights about the high variability of the care requirements and, by using models, find nurse-to-patient assignments that are nearly perfectly balanced. Conclusions: We illustrated this improvement with a pilot test that makes the equitable distribution of nursing workload the functionality of this strategy. The findings can be useful in highly complex hospitals in Latin America.

The mapping of factors related to syndrome and negative outcomes associated with it, also in middle age, may assist in health strategies to each age group. The aim of this study was to investigate social and health factors related to the frailty phenotype and to analyze the probabilistic relationships between frailty, falls and hospitalization in middle-aged and older persons. This is a cross-sectional study using data of 4442 middle-aged (50–59 years) and older participants (60 years or older) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) 2015 and 2016. Bayesian network models were estimated with the score-based hill-climbing algorithm to identify factors associated with frailty, falls and hospitalization. Mean age was 63.75 years, and prevalence of frailty was 8.5 % and 11.9 % among middle-aged and older participants, respectively. In the former, the probability of frailty increased when “poor” self-rated memory was considered in the model; and in the latter, the probability of frailty was greatest among individuals who did not participate socially and had the lowest level of education. In both age groups, frailty was an important factor that influenced the probability of negative health outcomes such as falls and hospitalization. However, this result depended on combinations of health factors in each sample.

However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood crime statistics affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support patient prioritization in a pilot behavioural intervention and will inform appointment planning decisions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics,Design science research,Healthcare access,No-show prediction"

Ecological niche modelling, once relying on an adequate framework and environmental descriptors can be a helpful tool for such purposes. Despite the existence of a vaccine, yellow fever (YF) is still a public health issue. Brazil faced massive sylvatic YF outbreaks from the end of 2016 up to mid-2018, but cases in human and non-human primates have been recorded until the beginning of 2020. Here we used both human and monkey confirmed YF cases from two epidemic periods (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) to describe the spatial distribution of the cases and explore how biotic and abiotic factors drive their occurrence. The distribution of YF cases largely overlaps for humans and monkeys, and a contraction of the spatial extent associated with a southward displacement is observed during the second period of the epi-demics. More contributive variables to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cases were related to biotic factors (mammal richness), abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), and some human-related variables (population density, human footprint, and human vaccination coverage). Both projections of the most favourable conditions showed similar trends with a contraction of the more at-risk areas. Once extrapolated at a large scale, the Amazon basin remains at lower risk, although surrounding forest regions and notably the North-West region, would face a higher risk. Spatial projections of infectious diseases often relied on climatic variables only; here for both models, we instead highlighted the importance of consid-ering local biotic conditions, hosts vulnerability, social and epidemiological factors to run the spatial risk analysis correctly: all YF cases occurring later on, in 2019 and 2020, were observed in the predicted at-risk areas. © 2020 de Thoisy et al.",

In order to exploit this knowledge by automated systems, there is a growing interest in developing text mining methodologies to extract, structure, and analyze in the shortest time possible the knowledge encoded in the large volume of medical literature. In this paper, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach to analyze the correlation between funding efforts and actually published research results in order to provide the policy makers with a systematic and rigorous tool to assess the efficiency of funding programs in the medical area. Results: We have tested our methodology in the Revista Médica de Chile, years 2012-2015. 50 relevant semantic topics were identified within 643 medical scientific research papers. Relationships between the identified semantic topics were uncovered using visualization methods. We have also been able to analyze the funding patterns of scientific research underlying these publications. We found that only 29% of the publications declare funding sources, and we identified five topic clusters that concentrate 86% of the declared funds. Conclusions: Our methodology allows analyzing and interpreting the current state of medical research at a national level.

25,SCOPUS_ID:85092255038,"The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is the spatial manifestation of human communities coupled with vegetated ecosystems. Spatial delineation of the WUI is important for wildfire policy and management, but is typically defined according to spatial relationships between housing development and wildland vegetation without explicit consideration of fire risk. A fire risk-based definition of WUI can enable a better distribution of management investment so as to maximize social return. We present a novel methodological approach to delineate the WUI based on a fire risk assessment. The approach establishes a geographical framework to model fire risk via machine learning and generate multi-scale, variable-specific spatial thresholds for translating fire probabilities into mapped output. To determine whether fire-based WUI mapping better captures the spatial congruence of houses and wildfires than conventional methods, we compared national and subnational fire-based WUI maps for Chile to WUI maps generated only with housing and vegetation thresholds. The two mapping approaches exhibited broadly similar spatial patterns, the WUI definitions covering almost the same area and containing similar proportions of the housing units in the area under study (17.1% vs. 17.9%), but the fire-based WUI accounted for 13.8% more spatial congruence of fires and people (47.1% vs. 33.2% of ignitions). Substantial regional variability was found in fire risk drivers and the corresponding spatial mapping thresholds, suggesting there are benefits to developing different WUI maps for different scales of application. We conclude that a dynamic, multi-scale, fire-based WUI mapping approach should provide more targeted and effective support for decision making than conventional approaches. © 2020 The Author(s).

Thanks to the Internet, today, we have a huge amount of health data and fire occurrence reports at our disposal. The challenge, therefore, is how to deal with 4 Vs (volume, variety, velocity and veracity) associated with these data. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a method that combines techniques based on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) to discover spatial and temporal association between diseases and the fire occurrences. Here, the case study was addressed to Malaria, Leishmaniasis and respiratory diseases in Brazil. Instead of losing a lot of time verifying the consistency of the database, the proposed method uses Decision Tree, a machine learning-based supervised classification, to perform a fast management and extract only relevant and strategic information, with the knowledge of how reliable the database is. Namely, States, Biomes and period of the year (months) with the highest rate of fires could be identified with great success rates and in few seconds. Then, the K-means, an unsupervised learning algorithms that solves the well-known clustering problem, is employed to identify the groups of cities where the fire occurrences is more expressive. Finally, the steps associated with KDD is perfomed to extract useful information from mined data. In that case, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, a nonparametric measure of rank correlation, is computed to infer the statistical dependence between fire occurrences and those diseases. Moreover, maps are also generated to represent the distribution of the mined data. From the results, it was possible to identify that each region showed a susceptible behaviour to some disease as well as some degree of correlation with fire outbreak, mainly in the drought period. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: We examined the budget for research projects relating to the number of cases and deaths and the relationship between each federal unit, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the national GDP per capita. Results: Using data from the websites of official funding agencies and the Brazilian government, we found that, in the first four months since the first case in Wuhan, China (December 31, 2019), around US$ 38.3 million were directed to public funding for scientific investigations against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, only 11 out of 27 federal units provided funding during the initial stages of the outbreak, and those that did provide financing were not necessarily the units having the most inhabitants, highest GDP, or the greatest number of cases. The areas of research interest were also identified in the funding documents; the most common topic was “diagnosis” and the least common was “equipment for treatment.” Conclusions: Brazilian researchers had access to funding opportunities for projects against COVID-19. However, strategies to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 are crucial in mitigating or avoiding substantial financial and social shortcomings, particularly in terms of an emerging market such as Brazil. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

After mapping hotspot areas for HPSR production, we then examined how the corresponding author's characteristics were associated with being accepted to present at the Global Symposia. Our findings showed that submissions for the Global Symposia increased by 12% from 2016 to 2018. Submissions increased across all participant groups, in particular, the for-profit organizations and research/consultancy firms showing the highest increases, at 58% for both. We also found reduced submissions from high-income countries, whereas submissions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, increased substantially revealing the inclusivity values of Symposium organizers.

This could be in the form of non-flowing water filled in tanks, barrels, discarded tires, and many other containers situated in human dwellings. After the ZIKV outbreak from 2015, the environmental agency in Brazil have intensively been engaged with routine surveillance of water bodies present in households and the environment to destroy mosquito breeding hotspots as public health measure to prevent vector-to-human transmission of ZIKV.

Methods: The following variables were included in the analysis: average bed to nurse, physiotherapist and physician ratios, presence of 24/7 board-certified intensivists and dedicated pharmacists in the ICU, and nurse and physiotherapist autonomy scores. Clusters were defined using the partition around medoids method. We assessed the association between clusters and hospital mortality using logistic regression and with ICU LOS and MV duration using competing risk regression. Results: Analysis included data from 129,680 patients admitted to 93 ICUs (2014–2015). Three clusters were identified. The features distinguishing between the clusters were: the presence of board-certified intensivists in the ICU 24/7 (present in Cluster 3), dedicated pharmacists (present in Clusters 2 and 3) and the extent of nurse autonomy (which increased from Clusters 1 to 3). The patients in Cluster 3 exhibited the best outcomes, with lower adjusted hospital mortality [odds ratio 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87–0.98)], shorter ICU LOS [subhazard ratio (SHR) for patients surviving to ICU discharge 1.24 (95% CI 1.22–1.26)] and shorter durations of MV [SHR for undergoing extubation 1.61(95% CI 1.54–1.69)].

Clinical diagnosis is essential, but some of the presented symptoms may go unnoticed, even by specialists. In areas of greater endemicity, serological and molecular tests have been performed and analyzed separately for the follow-up of household contacts, who are at high risk of developing the disease. The accuracy of these tests is still debated, and it is necessary to make them more reliable, especially for the identification of cases of leprosy between contacts. We proposed an integrated analysis of molecular and serological methods using artificial intelligence by the random forest (RF) algorithm to better diagnose and predict new cases of leprosy. Methods The study was developed in Governador Valadares, Brazil, a hyperendemic region for leprosy. A longitudinal study was performed, including new cases diagnosed in 2011 and their respective household contacts, who were followed in 2011, 2012, and 2016. All contacts were diligently evaluated by clinicians from Reference Center for Endemic Diseases (CRE-DEN-PES) before being classified as asymptomatic. Samples of slit skin smears (SSS) from the earlobe of the patients and household contacts were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA, and peripheral blood samples were collected for ELISA assays to detect LID-1 and ND-O-LID. Results The statistical analysis of the tests revealed sensitivity for anti-LID-1 (63.2%), anti-ND-O-LID (57.9%), qPCR SSS (36.8%), and smear microscopy (30.2%). However, the use of RF allowed for an expressive increase in sensitivity in the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy (90.5%) and especially paucibacillary leprosy (70.6%). It is important to report that the specificity was 92.5%.

Current widespread AMR pollution has posed a big challenge in accurately disentangling source-sink relationship, which has been further confounded by point and non-point sources, as well as endogenous and exogenous cross-reactivity under complicated environmental conditions. Because of insufficient capability in identifying source-sink relationship within a quantitative framework, traditional antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) signatures-based source-tracking methods would hardly be a practical solution. RESULTS: By combining broad-spectrum ARG profiling with machine-learning classification SourceTracker, here we present a novel way to address the question in the era of high-throughput sequencing. Its potential in extensive application was firstly validated by 656 global-scale samples covering diverse environmental types (e.g., human/animal gut, wastewater, soil, ocean) and broad geographical regions (e.g., China, USA, Europe, Peru). Its potential and limitations in source prediction as well as effect of parameter adjustment were then rigorously evaluated by artificial configurations with representative source proportions. When applying SourceTracker in region-specific analysis, excellent performance was achieved by ARG profiles in two sample types with obvious different source compositions, i.e., influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant. Two environmental metagenomic datasets of anthropogenic interference gradient further supported its potential in practical application. To complement general-profile-based source tracking in distinguishing continuous gradient pollution, a few generalist and specialist indicator ARGs across ecotypes were identified in this study. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated for the first time that the developed source-tracking platform when coupling with proper experiment design and efficient metagenomic analysis tools will have significant implications for assessing AMR pollution. Following predicted source contribution status, risk ranking of different sources in ARG dissemination will be possible, thereby paving the way for establishing priority in mitigating ARG spread and designing effective control strategies.","Antibiotic resistance gene,Machine learning classification,Metagenomics,Source tracking"

Methods: Our outcome was life expectancy at birth for Brazilian municipalities, and we used as predictors 60 local characteristics that are not directly controlled by public health officials (e.g., socioeconomic factors). Results: The highest predictive performance was achieved by an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (cross-validated mean squared error of 0.168), including a 35% gain in comparison with standard decision trees. Overachievers presented better results regarding primary health care, such as higher coverage of the massive multidisciplinary program Family Health Strategy. On the other hand, underachievers performed more cesarean deliveries and mammographies and had more life-support health equipment. Conclusions: The findings suggest that analyzing the predicted value of a health outcome may bring insights about good public health practices. Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

47,SCOPUS_ID:85039786287,"In a town located in a desert area of Northern Chile, gold and copper open–pit mining is carried out involving explosive processes. These processes are associated with increased dust exposure, which might affect children’s respiratory health. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the causal attributable risk of living close to the mines on asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis risk burden in children. Data on the prevalence of respiratory diseases and potential confounders were available from a cross-sectional survey carried out in 2009 among 288 (response: 69%) children living in the community. The proximity of the children’s home addresses to the local gold and copper mine was calculated using geographical positioning systems. We applied targeted maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the causal attributable risk (CAR) for asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and both outcomes combined. Children living more than the first quartile away from the mines were used as the unexposed group. Based on the estimated CAR, a hypothetical intervention in which all children lived at least one quartile away from the copper mine would decrease the risk of rhinoconjunctivitis by 4.7 percentage points (CAR: –4.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): –8.4; –0.11); and 4.2 percentage points (CAR: –4.2; 95% CI: –7.9;–0.05) for both outcomes combined. Overall, our results suggest that a hypothetical intervention intended to increase the distance between the place of residence of the highest exposed children would reduce the prevalence of respiratory disease in the community by around four percentage points. This approach could help local policymakers in the development of efficient public health strategies. © 2017 by the authors.

48,SCOPUS_ID:85029576985,"Background and Objective Recent progression towards precision medicine has encouraged the use of electronic health records (EHRs) as a source for large amounts of data, which is required for studying the effect of treatments or risk factors in more specific subpopulations. Phenotyping algorithms allow to automatically classify patients according to their particular electronic phenotype thus facilitating the setup of retrospective cohorts. Our objective is to compare the performance of different classification strategies (only using standardized problems, rule-based algorithms, statistical learning algorithms (six learners) and stacked generalization (five versions)), for the categorization of patients according to their diabetic status (diabetics, not diabetics and inconclusive; Diabetes of any type) using information extracted from EHRs. Methods Patient information was extracted from the EHR at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. For the derivation and validation datasets, two probabilistic samples of patients from different years (2005: n = 1663; 2015: n = 800) were extracted. The only inclusion criterion was age (≥40 & <80 years). Four researchers manually reviewed all records and classified patients according to their diabetic status (diabetic: diabetes registered as a health problem or fulfilling the ADA criteria; non-diabetic: not fulfilling the ADA criteria and having at least one fasting glycemia below 126 mg/dL; inconclusive: no data regarding their diabetic status or only one abnormal value). The best performing algorithms within each strategy were tested on the validation set. Results The standardized codes algorithm achieved a Kappa coefficient value of 0.59 (95% CI 0.49, 0.59) in the validation set. The Boolean logic algorithm reached 0.82 (95% CI 0.76, 0.88). A slightly higher value was achieved by the Feedforward Neural Network (0.9, 95% CI 0.85, 0.94). The best performing learner was the stacked generalization meta-learner that reached a Kappa coefficient value of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 0.98). Conclusions The stacked generalization strategy and the feedforward neural network showed the best classification metrics in the validation set. The implementation of these algorithms enables the exploitation of the data of thousands of patients accurately. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diabetes Mellitus,Electronic health records,Electronic phenotyping algorithms,Stacked generalization"
49,SCOPUS_ID:85026398611,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease associated with a wide range of serious health complications that have a major impact on overall health. The aims here were to develop and validate predictive models for detecting undiagnosed diabetes using data from the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) and to compare the performance of different machine-learning algorithms in this task. DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of machine-learning algorithms to develop predictive models using data from ELSA-Brasil. METHODS: After selecting a subset of 27 candidate variables from the literature, models were built and validated in four sequential steps: (i) parameter tuning with tenfold cross-validation, repeated three times; (ii) automatic variable selection using forward selection, a wrapper strategy with four different machine-learning algorithms and tenfold cross-validation (repeated three times), to evaluate each subset of variables; (iii) error estimation of model parameters with tenfold cross-validation, repeated ten times; and (iv) generalization testing on an independent dataset. The models were created with the following machine-learning algorithms: logistic regression, artificial neural network, naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor and random forest. RESULTS: The best models were created using artificial neural networks and logistic regression. These achieved mean areas under the curve of, respectively, 75.24% and 74.98% in the error estimation step and 74.17% and 74.41% in the generalization testing step. CONCLUSION: Most of the predictive models produced similar results, and demonstrated the feasibility of identifying individuals with highest probability of having undiagnosed diabetes, through easily-obtained clinical data. © 2017, Associacao Paulista de Medicina.

50,SCOPUS_ID:84906903435,"Among several streamflow forecasting techniques, data-driven models (DDMs) are widely used. They employ a database formed by historical input (precipitation and streamflow) and output (streamflow) variables to perform the prediction. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the most common types of DDMs, and are typically more accurate than other empirical models, but have the disadvantage of not being sufficiently transparent. One of the machine-learning methods that do not have this problem is the so-called ""instance-based learning"" (IBL). The KNN algorithm is an example of IBL. This research applies and proposes variations of the KNN model in order to forecast streamflows in a river of the state of Sergipe, Brazil. The results are compared to simulations carried out by the use of artificial neural networks and indicate the superiority of the ANNs, but also show satisfactory forecasts of the KNN.","Artificial intelligence,Data mining,Hydrological forecasting"
51,SCOPUS_ID:84884418479,"Objectives: during 2007 the Chilean Ministry of Public Health introduced the Model of Integrated and Humanized Health Services, in addition to the Clinical Guide for Humanized Care during Delivery. Three years after its implementation, a study was conducted (i) to describe selected clinical outcomes of women who received care within this model, (ii) to identify the degree of maternal-newborn well-being and (iii) to explore the perception of this humanised attention during labour and delivery by both the professional staff (obstetricians and midwives) and consumers. Design and method: a cross-sectional, descriptive study using both quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted with 508 women who delivered in two major hospitals within the National Health System in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile, from September 2010 until June 2011. The quantitative methods included a validated survey of maternal well-being and an adapted version of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) standardised antepartum and intrapartum data set. The qualitative methods included six focus groups discussions (FGDs), with midwives, obstetricians and consumers. Additionally, two in depth interviews were carried out with the directors of the maternity units. Findings: the quantitative findings showed poor implementation of the guidelines: 92.7% of the women had medically induced labours (artificial rupture of the membranes and received oxytocin and epidural anaesthesia), and almost one-third of the women reported discontent with the care they received. The qualitative findings showed that the main complaint perceived by the midwives was that the health system was highly hierarchical and medicalised and that the obstetricians were not engaged in this modality of assistance. The women (consumers) highlighted that professionals (midwives and obstetricians) were highly technically skilled, and they felt confident in their assistance. However, women complained about receiving inadequate personal treatment from these professionals. The obstetricians showed no self-critique, stating that they always expressed concern for their patients and that they provided humanised professional assistance. Conclusions and implications for practice: by illuminating the main strengths and weakness with regard to the application of the model, these findings can help to inform strategies and actions to improve its implementation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Humanisation of labour,Maternal and newborn well-being,Midwifery model"
52,SCOPUS_ID:85024803930,"Many medical physicists have been contributing to make a difference in the world through international organizations. So much has happened and is happening in large part of the world particularly when it comes to assessment of radiation doses to patients in over 50 developing countries, comparing doses with international standards and managing doses. Further preparing and disseminating training material in different languages, QC activities and training courses are activities that have required expertise of AAPM and IOMP members. In recent years more than a dozen papers have been published in peer‐reviewed journals. The momentum generated creates opportunities for collaboration and cooperation between medical physicists from developing countries and with those in USA. AAPM members can contribute effectively in this very stimulating area of work. You can be part of the exercise of making a difference in the world, in making patients safer and in improving the knowledge of colleagues in developing countries. Madan Rehani will report on approaches utilized in his work through IAEA, Vienna in more than 50 developing countries. Starting from training courses, going over to training material development and making them available for free download in many languages, the use of website as a resource, multinational studies coordinated centrally and ultimately preparing posters that can be used on every x‐ray machine of the world. The talk will cover how you can contribute. Marilyn Goske, a radiologist from Cincinnati and reformer with impact at global level will review successful strategies that have promoted large scale quality improvement. While there is an increasing body of work that discussed practice quality improvement at a facility level, how can this knowledge be leveraged for quality improvement on a much larger scale in medical physics? This talk will review successful strategies and discuss how these strategies can be applied to the medical physicist community for the purpose of optimizing radiation dose and improving care of children worldwide Jenia Vassileva from Bulgaria will report on results from the largest multinational study of pediatric CT practice in 40 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America initiated and coordinated by the IAEA. In most facilities, paediatric‐specific protocols were being used but these CT protocols were not well optimised. In 8% of the devices CTDI values for paediatric patients were higher than for adults in at least one age group and one examination, in 40% of facilities the imaging protocols were not adapted to the body size. Large variations were found in CTDI values for the same CT examination and the same age group. Patient dose records were kept in less than half of the facilities. Creation of multinational networks appears to be a very effective mechanism. Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with on‐going work in over 50 developing countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America on radiation protection of patients 2. To understand mechanism of cooperation and collaboration 3. To review success and failures for future planning of work in large part of the world. © 2013, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.",

Adopting the deterministic method and similarity functions (Dice, Jaro, Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein) for the integration of heterogeneous databases aimed at different levels of health care Brazilian (primary, secondary and tertiary). The sensitivity of deterministic method was 54.5% (95% CI: 50.4 to 58.5). The best result obtained with the dissent of only one variable (mother's name) was 80.6% (95% CI: 77.2 to 83.6) and the best result obtained using the similarity function Jaro-Winkler was 91.8% (95% CI: 89.4 to 93.9). The deterministic method has high specificity but sensitivity can be reduced by the existence of spellings and typing errors in the databases. Thus, the step-by-step approach where there was disagreement in at least one of the relationship variable can increase the sensitivity of the method and the use of similarity functions. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.","database record linkage,deterministic record linkage,Information systems,similarity function"

Due to the scarcity of neuropsychological tests that assess brain function in congenital blind children in Brazil, Planned Codes provided satisfactory scenery and needed to adapt to the reality of the applicator and children, containing, therefore, features tactile, visual and translated into Portuguese. Moreover, the high-tech offered by Orange Canvas program, favored the possibility of completely automating the entire subtest. The sample consisted of 59 congenital blind children which are students of Specialized School, where 32 realized the whole subtest being 2 of 7 years old and 28 from 8 to 12 years old. To validate this study, was made a clustering of data inherent to the subtest with predictions drawn from behavioral analysis of children, through the Orange Canvas, where it was confirmed the effectiveness of that procedure in clustering the data associated with the predictions suggested.
