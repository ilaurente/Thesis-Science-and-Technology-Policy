0,SCOPUS_ID:85117816195,"Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) can be estimated using the FAO56-Penman-Monteith (FAO56-PM) equation but it requires commonly unavailable meteorological data. Therefore, this study assessed different approaches to estimate ETo based on temperature and relative humidity, and temperature only across Brazil, as follows: (i) using the FAO56-PM equation with missing data estimated based on FAO56 methodologies; (ii) using the FAO56-PM equation with missing data estimated based on machine learning; and (iii) estimating ETo directly using machine learning. The FAO56-PM equation was also calibrated through linear regression and by calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data. The potential benefits of using multi-task learning (MTL) and clustering were also investigated. Data from 437 weather stations were used. Artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) were employed. In both general and clustering scenarios, calibrating the FAO56-PM equation using linear regression provided slightly better results than calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data. In contrast to temperature- and relative humidity-based FAO56-PM equation, its temperature-based version performed better before both calibration types assessed. The machine learning models performed the best to estimate ETo and missing data. Combining the machine learning models with the FAO56-PM equation to estimate ETo performed similarly to using them individually. MTL and single-task learning (STL) provided similar results. In the general scenario, for the temperature-based models, using PM-ANN-STL increased mean NSE from 0.49 to 0.53 in relation to the non-calibrated FAO56-PM equation. For the temperature- and relative humidity-based models, using ANN and RF developed with STL or MTL increased NSE from 0.56 to 0.67 in relation to the FAO56-PM equation calibrated using linear regression. When using the clustering strategy, performance gains were obtained in estimating ETo with the temperature-based models, increasing mean NSE up to 0.58. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Generalizability,MARS,Neural networks,Solar radiation,Wind speed"
1,SCOPUS_ID:85099809927,"Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is the main leafy vegetable produced in Brazil. Since its production is widespread all over the country, lettuce traceability and quality assurance is hampered. In this study, we propose a new method to identify the geographical origin of Brazilian lettuce. The method uses a powerful data mining technique called support vector machines (SVM) applied to elemental composition and soil properties of samples analyzed. We investigated lettuce produced in São Paulo and Pernambuco, two states in the southeastern and northeastern regions in Brazil, respectively. We investigated efficiency of the SVM model by comparing its results with those achieved by traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The SVM models outperformed the LDA models in the two scenarios investigated, achieving an average of 98 % prediction accuracy to discriminate lettuce from both states. A feature evaluation formula, called F–score, was used to measure the discriminative power of the variables analyzed. The soil exchangeable cation capacity, soil contents of low crystalized Al and Zn content in lettuce samples were the most relevant components for differentiation. Our results reinforce the potential of data mining and machine learning techniques to support traceability strategies and authentication of leafy vegetables. © 2022, University of Sao Paolo.

2,SCOPUS_ID:85116100214,"Currently, the adoption of smart technologies for sustainable farming systems creates a distinct competitive edge for farmers, extension services, agri-business, and policy-makers. However, selecting the most appropriate technologies from a wide range of options is never an easy job. In this context, several authors consider Smart Farming as the best solution. However, they fall short in providing more information to recommend the most appropriate IoT technology, the options to manage the IoT infrastructure, and the services to crop management plans and crop production estimation. This paper implements a Smart Farming System based on a three-layered architecture (Agriculture Perception, Edge Computing, and Data Analytics). In the Agriculture Perception Layer, we evaluated Omicron, Libelium, and Intel technologies under criteria such as the price, the number of inputs for sensor connection, communication protocols, portability, battery life, and harvesting energy system photovoltaic panel. We evaluated edge-based management mechanisms in the Edge Layer to provide data reliability, focusing on outlier detection and treatment using Machine Learning and Interpolation algorithms. We recommend the Isolation Forest algorithm for classifying outliers in the monthly temperature dataset (99% of precision) and the Cubic Spline technique for effectively replacing the data classified as outliers (RMSE lower than 0.085). In the Data Analytics Layer, we evaluated different machine learning algorithms to estimate coffee production. The results show that the measured error values of the XGBOOST algorithm keep the values lower than the other models (RMSE 0.008, MAE 0.032, and RSE 0.585). The www.iot-agro.com platform offers farmer services such as weather variables monitoring, coffee production estimating, and IoT infrastructure setting. Finally, stakeholders, researchers, and engineers validated our Smart Farming Solution through a Colombian coffee farm case study. The test evaluated the usability, the straightforward interpretation of data, and the look feel of the web application. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","BPMN,Coffee Farm,Data Analytics,Internet of Things,Outlier Detection,Smart Farming"
3,SCOPUS_ID:85108877601,"One of the great challenges in the geosciences is mapping targets and phenomena that are not fully in direct range of imaging instruments such as remote sensors. Thus, soil maps are still scarce, especially at the detail level for large regions, with the few official maps being restricted to small spatial cutouts, resulting in an increasing demand for pedological information. The aim of this work was to analyze the use of covariates related to geological and terrain attributes on the performance of soil class predictive models for digital soil mapping with pixel- and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approaches in the context of sub-humid tropical environments of the Cerrado biome, in central-western Brazil, to reproduce a conventional map. A reference soil map at the scale 1:50,000 with twelve soil classes was used. Randomly stratified samples and the Random Forest (RF) classifier was performed with seventeen digital elevation model derivatives and the geology categorical data (lithostratigraphic units) as covariates for the prediction of soil classes in both approaches. The main results demonstrated that GEOBIA is a promising method for mapping soil classes, with overall accuracy of 0.70, which is 5% higher than pixel-based. The most important covariates for soil class mapping were related to Geology and terrain attributes: Altitude, Vertical Distance to Channel Network, Vector Terrain Ruggedness, Relative Slope Position, Topographic Height, Profile Curvature, Roughness, Slope, and Valley Depth. The integration of the geological covariate improved the models in both approaches. Integrated evaluation of the geological units and terrain attributes along with the use of machine learning techniques, such as the RF algorithm, is a promising and relevant strategy for digital predictive mapping of soil classes that can contribute toward the greater reproducibility of conventional soil maps. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Digital soil mapping,Digital terrain analysis,Geological substrate,Random forest"
4,SCOPUS_ID:85109117093,"Straw removal requires a complex set of mechanized operations, including machines for raking, baling, and transporting the straw, which may intensify soil physical degradation in sugarcane fields. A field experiment was conducted to estimate the stress transmitted caused by a set of machines used for sugarcane straw removal and to quantify the impact of these stresses on soil physical indicators. The treatments consisted of reproducing the field traffic of individual and sequential operations used for straw removal, including raking; raking + baling; and raking + baling + transporting operations. Soil bulk density (BD), soil penetration resistance (SPR), macroporosity (MaP) and microporosity (MiP) at the depths of 2.5, 5, 15, and 30 cm were measured before and after the field operations. Contact area of the tires and stress transmitted into the soil induced by the straw removal operations were simulated by SoilFlex model and then used to assess the magnitude of the changes in soil physical indicators. Results showed that baling operation transmitted the highest stress (∼400 kPa), followed by straw raking and transporting, whose transmitted stress level exceed 300 kPa near the soil surface. The sum of sequential operations (i.e., raking + bale + transporting) showed the highest negative impact on soil physical quality. The magnitude of the changes in soil physical indicators occurred according to initial conditions of BD and transmitted stress. Our results show that operations for straw removal intensify soil compaction, which can be detrimental to sustain soil health and plant growth. Therefore, we advocate that traffic control strategies should be adopted during the straw removal operations to improve soil quality towards greater sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy,Field traffic,Soil physical disturbance,Soil porosity,Straw baling route"
5,SCOPUS_ID:85107618308,"Brazil is one of the leading timber producers in the world. However, in South Brazil, frost events frequently cause damage and reduce yield in forest plantations, a situation predicted to become more common under global change scenarios. This raises the need for low cost and efficient tools, such as machine learning algorithms to improve forecasting of frost risk. This study used machine learning algorithms to create zoning classifications forecasting frost risk for forest plantations located in the south-central region of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. For this, we gathered and processed data from a local geodatabase (i.e. high-spatial-resolution contour lines, hydrography, and forest stands limits) comprising 30 management units with consistent historical data of frost occurrence. Then, we generated possible local-scale predictors of frost occurrence, which included longitude, latitude, elevation, relative altitude, relief orientation, and Euclidean distance from hydrography. We carried out tests of three machine learning classifiers (Random Forest – RF; Support Vector Machine-SVM and Multi-layer Perceptron-MLP) in order to determine which would most accurately predict frost occurrence. We found that RF provided the highest accuracy (> 90%), as well as the smallest percentages of class-specific errors (i.e. commission and omission errors), when compared to SVM and MLP. Latitude was the most important predictor of frost occurrence when using RF. Conversely, MLP performed worst, especially for classifying frost occurrence versus non-occurrence, and therefore had the highest percentage of class-specific errors. Our findings lead us to conclude that RF is the most proficient algorithm for forecasting frost occurrence from local-scale geomorphological data, without the need for high-cost investment in micro-meteorological sensors to monitor climate frost events linking temperature to plant damage. With increasing global climate extreme events, accurate risk zoning is essential for planning strategies of plantation at the landscape scale. © 2021","Climatic forecast,Forest production,Frost Events,Geoprocessing,Machine learning algorithms"
6,SCOPUS_ID:85108849717,"In science, estimation is the calculation of a current value, while forecasting (or prediction) is the calculation of a future value. Both estimation and forecasting are based on covariates. However, whereas estimation enables greater agility in current decision making, forecasting can reveal different strategies for the future. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has brought improvements in accuracy to the estimation and forecasting of agricultural yield for various crops around the world. These models are part of a set of machine-learning models, becoming an important ally not only to producers, companies, cooperatives, and to government institutions for decisions making and strategic decisions at all levels of the agricultural system. The main constraints of agricultural production are climatic conditions and soil water availability during crop cycles. We propose the use of ANNs for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield estimation and forecasting 2 mo before harvesting in the region of MATOPIBA, the largest and the last agricultural frontier of Brazil. This tropical agricultural area has about 73,173,485 hectares, corresponding to approximately 1.3 times the area of France. The input features for ANN were the monthly climatic conditions of air temperature, precipitation, and global radiation, as well as components of the water balance such as crop evapotranspiration, soil water storage, actual evapotranspiration, water deficiency, and surpluses during the cultivation cycle. The evaluation of ANN for yield estimation had R2 =.88 and RMSE = 167.85 kg ha–1, while the ANN for forecasting obtained R2 =.86 and RMSE = 185.85 kg ha–1. © 2021 The Authors.

7,SCOPUS_ID:85105340476,"Wildlife-vehicle collision - WVC is a phenomenon that arises from the fragmentation of ecosystems by roads, limiting the mobility of individuals and putting at risk the stability of populations by increasing mortality. Colombia is not unaware of the problem of the WVC, evidenced in different scientific publications that describe the WVC in the roads of the country. Although the rise of artificial intelligence has significant advances in the prediction of spatial phenomena in recent years, it has not yet been sufficiently explored by Road Ecology. For this reason, this research aimed to develop a methodology to predict the sites of accumulation of WVC in eastern Antioquia, Colombia, based on artificial intelligence algorithms, geographic information systems - GIS, and multispectral image processing. During the development of this research, it was identified that the features most related to the WVC in the study area are: Distance to Forest, Distance to Biological Corridor, Ground Resistance to Movement, Cost of Movement, the bands of the Landsat 8 satellite: 9, 10, 11 and the normalized burning index (NBRI). Different machine learning algorithms were compared (k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and artificial neural networks). SMOTE and ADASYN balancing techniques were applied. The results allowed to identify that the RF algorithm with ADASYN yielded the best performance when subjected to spatial-wise cross-validation (AUC-ROC 0.78 ± 0.12), surpassing the results of current state-of-the-art. Finally, the methodology was validated through a transfer learning experiment, training the RF-ADASYN algorithm with three zones of the eastern Antioquia region and validating on a different section (AUC-ROC = 0.87 ± 0.09), retraining the initial model with 5% of data from the validation database. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning,Multispectral imagery,Pattern recognition,Spatial analysis,Wildlife-vehicle collision"
8,SCOPUS_ID:85087303493,"Spatially resolved estimates of change in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are necessary for supporting national and international policies aimed at achieving land degradation neutrality and climate change mitigation. In this work we report on the development, implementation and application of a data-driven, statistical method for mapping SOC stocks in space and time, using Argentina as a pilot. We used quantile regression forest machine learning to predict annual SOC stock at 0–30 cm depth at 250 m resolution for Argentina between 1982 and 2017. The model was calibrated using over 5,000 SOC stock values from the 36-year time period and 35 environmental covariates. We preprocessed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dynamic covariates using a temporal low-pass filter to allow the SOC stock for a given year to depend on the NDVI of the current as well as preceding years. Predictions had modest temporal variation, with an average decrease for the entire country from 2.55 to 2.48 kg C m−2 over the 36-year period (equivalent to a decline of 211 Gg C, 3.0% of the total 0–30 cm SOC stock in Argentina). The Pampa region had a larger estimated SOC stock decrease from 4.62 to 4.34 kg C m−2 (5.9%) during the same period. For the 2001–2015 period, predicted temporal variation was seven-fold larger than that obtained using the Tier 1 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Prediction uncertainties turned out to be substantial, mainly due to the limited number and poor spatial and temporal distribution of the calibration data, and the limited explanatory power of the covariates. Cross-validation confirmed that SOC stock prediction accuracy was limited, with a mean error of 0.03 kg C m−2 and a root mean squared error of 2.04 kg C m−2. In spite of the large uncertainties, this work showed that machine learning methods can be used for space–time SOC mapping and may yield valuable information to land managers and policymakers, provided that SOC observation density in space and time is sufficiently large. Highlights: We tested the use of machine learning for space–time mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. Predictions for Argentina from 1982 to 2017 showed a 3% decrease of the topsoil SOC stock over time. The machine learning model predicted a greater temporal variation than the IPCC Tier 1 approach. Accurate machine learning SOC stock prediction requires dense soil sampling in space and time. © 2020 The Authors.

9,SCOPUS_ID:85107932079,"<p>Vegetation optical depth (VOD) from microwave satellite observations has received much attention in global vegetation studies in recent years due to its relationship to vegetation water content and biomass. We recently have shown that VOD is related to plant productivity, i.e., gross primary production (GPP). Based on this relationship between VOD and GPP, we developed a theory-based machine learning model to estimate global patterns of GPP from passive microwave VOD retrievals. The VOD-GPP model generally showed good agreement with site observations and other global data sets in temporal dynamic but tended to overestimate annual GPP across all latitudes. We hypothesized that the reason for the overestimation is the missing effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration in the theory-based machine learning model. Here we aim to further assess and enhance the robustness of the VOD-GPP model by including the effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration within the machine learning approach and by assessing the interannual variability of the model results with respect to water availability. We used X-band VOD from the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA) data set for estimating GPP and used global state-of-the-art GPP data sets from FLUXCOM and MODIS to assess residuals of the VOD-GPP model with respect to drought conditions as quantified by the Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI).</p> <p>Our results reveal an improvement in model performance for correlation when including the temperature dependency of autotrophic respiration (average correlation increase of 0.18). This improvement in temporal dynamic is larger for temperate and cold regions than for the tropics. For unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and bias, the results are regionally diverse and are compensated in the global average. Improvements are observed in temperate and cold regions, while decreases in performance are obtained mainly in the tropics. The overall improvement when adding temperature was less than expected and thus may only partly explain previously observed differences between the global GPP data sets. On interannual timescales, estimates of the VOD-GPP model agree well with GPP from FLUXCOM and MODIS. We further find that the residuals between VOD-based GPP estimates and the other data sets do not significantly correlate with SPEI, which demonstrates that the VOD-GPP model can capture responses of GPP to water availability even without including additional information on precipitation, soil moisture or evapotranspiration. Exceptions from this rule were found in some regions: significant negative correlations between VOD-GPP residuals and SPEI were observed in the US corn belt, Argentina, eastern Europe, Russia and China, while significant positive correlations were obtained in South America, Africa and Australia. In these regions, the significant correlations may indicate different plant strategies for dealing with variations in water availability.</p> <p>Overall, our findings support the robustness of global microwave-derived estimates of gross primary production for large-scale studies on climate-vegetation interactions.</p> © Copyright:",
10,SCOPUS_ID:85096656152,"This study aimed to assess the predictive ability of different machine learning (ML) methods for genomic prediction of reproductive traits in Nellore cattle. The studied traits were age at first calving (AFC), scrotal circumference (SC), early pregnancy (EP) and stayability (STAY). The numbers of genotyped animals and SNP markers available were 2342 and 321 419 (AFC), 4671 and 309 486 (SC), 2681 and 319 619 (STAY) and 3356 and 319 108 (EP). Predictive ability of support vector regression (SVR), Bayesian regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) and random forest (RF) were compared with results obtained using parametric models (genomic best linear unbiased predictor, GBLUP, and Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, BLASSO). A 5-fold cross-validation strategy was performed and the average prediction accuracy (ACC) and mean squared errors (MSE) were computed. The ACC was defined as the linear correlation between predicted and observed breeding values for categorical traits (EP and STAY) and as the correlation between predicted and observed adjusted phenotypes divided by the square root of the estimated heritability for continuous traits (AFC and SC). The average ACC varied from low to moderate depending on the trait and model under consideration, ranging between 0.56 and 0.63 (AFC), 0.27 and 0.36 (SC), 0.57 and 0.67 (EP), and 0.52 and 0.62 (STAY). SVR provided slightly better accuracies than the parametric models for all traits, increasing the prediction accuracy for AFC to around 6.3 and 4.8% compared with GBLUP and BLASSO respectively. Likewise, there was an increase of 8.3% for SC, 4.5% for EP and 4.8% for STAY, comparing SVR with both GBLUP and BLASSO. In contrast, the RF and BRANN did not present competitive predictive ability compared with the parametric models. The results indicate that SVR is a suitable method for genome-enabled prediction of reproductive traits in Nellore cattle. Further, the optimal kernel bandwidth parameter in the SVR model was trait-dependent, thus, a fine-tuning for this hyper-parameter in the training phase is crucial. © 2020 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics","artificial neural network,fertility traits,genomic selection,random forest,support vector regression"
11,SCOPUS_ID:85114726912,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.)grain quality is a set of complex interrelated traits that include grain milling, appearance, cooking, and edible properties. As consumer preferences in Latin America and the Caribbean evolve, determining what traits best capture regional grain quality preferences is fundamental for breeding and cultivar release. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS), marker-assisted selection (MAS), and genomic selection (GS) were evaluated to help guide the development of new breeding strategies for rice grain quality improvement. For this purpose, 284 rice lines representing over 20 yr of breeding in Latin America and the Caribbean were genotyped and phenotyped for 10 different traits including grain milling, appearance, cooking, and edible quality traits. Genetic correlations among the 10 traits ranged from −0.83 to 0.85. A GWAS identified 19 significant marker/trait combinations associated with eight grain quality traits. Four functional markers, three located in the Waxy and one in the starch synthase IIa genes, were significantly associated with six grain-quality traits. These markers individually explained 51–75% of the phenotypic variance depending on the trait, clearly indicating their potential utility for MAS. Cross-validation studies to evaluate predictive abilities of four different GS models for each of the 10 quality traits were conducted and predictive abilities ranged from 0.3 to 0.72. Overall, the machine learning model random forest had the highest predictive abilities and was especially effective for traits where large effect quantitative trait loci were identified.

12,SCOPUS_ID:85088973886,"The critically endangered Brazilian pine, also called araucaria, (Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze) is a key species of the Araucaria moist forest (AMF, Mixed Ombrophilous Forest). Illegal timber extraction, agricultural conversion and severe degradation have reduced the AMF to only 13 per cent of its original cover, with climate change imposing additional challenges for cold adapted species such as araucaria. Previous studies have assessed climate change impacts on A. angustifolia, but have been limited by analysis constraints. Here, we used a machine learning technique to understand how land use and climate change might affect the distribution of A. angustifolia, and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing protected areas (PAs) to conserve this species. Our results demonstrated that despite the recent efforts to conserve the Atlantic Forest, conversion of natural habitats into forest plantation still occurs within araucaria's distribution range. Our model predicted a drastic reduction in environmentally suitable areas for this species of up to 77 per cent in the coming decades. Also, the existing PAs show low efficacy to protect suitable areas in the future. Combined, these results suggest that A. angustifolia will be under great threat within the next few decades and the development of conservation strategies to save this species is essential. Ideally, the conservation programs should integrate in situ and on farm approaches, including forest management strategies. Although in situ strategies play an important role as gene banks, on-farm strategies can be used to promote the restoration and expansion of A. angustifolia populations in the areas predicted as suitable. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2019.

Data from 53 weather stations located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were used. Four stations were used as test stations. Two baselines were also employed: (B1), all the forecasting horizon is considered equal to the mean ETo measured during the last seven days; and (B2), ahead ETo values are considered equal to their respective historical monthly means. In general, MIMO was the best forecasting strategy, offering good performance and lower computational cost.

The regional models are recommended instead of the local models since they exhibited similar performances and have higher generalization capacity.

It uses a criterion-based sampling strategy from the Optimization based on Phylogram Analysis. Called FS-opa, the new approach seems proper for dealing with any types of raw data from health centers and manipulate their entire datasets. Besides, FS-opa can find the principal features for the construction of inference models without depending on expert knowledge of the problem domain. The selected features can be combined with usual statistical or machine learning methods to perform predictions. The new method can mine entire datasets from scratch.

Cox’s approach was integrated to FS-opa to generate survival analysis models related to the length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, assuming that it is a relevant aspect that can benefit estimates of the efficiency of hospitals and the quality of patient treatments. Since FS-opa can work with raw datasets, no knowledge from the problem domain was used to obtain the preliminary prediction models found. Results show that FS-opa succeeded in performing a feature sensitivity analysis using only the raw data available. In this way, FS-opa can find the principal features without bias of an inference model, since the proposed method does not use it. Moreover, the experiments show that FS-opa can provide models with a useful trade-off according to their representativeness and parsimony. It can benefit further analyses by experts since they can focus on aspects that benefit problem modeling. © 2020 Gholi Zadeh Kharrat et al.

19,SCOPUS_ID:85087092701,"The objective of this work is to evaluate the capacity of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series imagery, acquired by the European satellite Sentinel-1 (S1), for the agriculture crop classification and its reliability to differentiate onion from sunflower, among others. The work then focused on classifying land cover in intensively cultivated agricultural regions. The study was developed in the Bonaerense Valley of the Colorado River (BVCR), Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, backed up by the field truth of 1634 field samples. In addition to the onion and sunflower crops, there are other crops present in the study area such as cereals, alfalfa, potatoes and maize, which are considered as the image background in the classification process. The field samples database was used for training and supporting a supervised classification with two machine learning algorithms—Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—obtaining high levels of accuracy in each case. Different S1 SAR time-series features were used to assess the performance of S1 crop classification in terms of polarization VH+VV, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) image texture and a combination of both. The analysis of SAR data and their features was carried out at OBIA lot level (Object Based Image Analysis) showing an optimal strategy to counteract the effect of the residual and inherent speckle noise of the radar signal. In the process of differentiating onion and sunflower crops, the analysis of the VH+VV stack with the SVM algorithm delivered the best statistical classification results in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index, (Kp) when other crops (image background) were not considered (OA = 95.35%, Kp = 0.89). Certainly, the GLCM texture analysis derived from the S1 SAR images is a valuable source of information for obtaining very good classification results. When differentiating sunflower from onion considering also other crops present in the BVCR, the GLCM stack proved to be the most suitable dataset analyzed in this work (OA = 89.98%, Kp = 0.66 for SVM algorithm). This working methodology is applicable to other irrigated valleys in Argentina dedicated to intensive crops. There are also variables inherent to each lot, soil, crop and agricultural producer that differ according to the study area and that should be considered for each case in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Land cover,Onion crop,Sentinel-1,Sunflower crop,Supervised classification,Time-series"
20,SCOPUS_ID:85086805577,"This study aimed to understand the perception of drought among farmers, in order to support decision-making in the water allocation process. This study was carried out in the Tabuleiro de Russas irrigated perimeter, in northeast Brazil, over the drought period of 2012-2018. Two analyses were conducted: (i) drought characterization, using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on drought duration and frequency criteria; and (ii) analysis of farmers' perceptions of drought via selection of explanatory variables using the Random Forest (RF) and the Decision Tree (DT) methods. The 2012-2018 drought period was defined as a meteorological phenomenon by local farmers; however, an SPI evaluation indicated that the drought was of a hydrological nature. According to the RF analysis, four of the nine study variables were more statistically important than the others in influencing farmers' perception of drought: number of cultivated land plots, farmer's age, years of experience in the agriculture sector, and education level. These results were confirmed using DT analysis. Understanding the relationship between these variables and farmers' perception of drought could aid in the development of an adaptation strategy to water deficit scenarios. Farmers' perception can be beneficial in reducing conflicts, adopting proactive management practices, and developing a holistic and efficient early warning drought system. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision Tree,Drought perception,Irrigated agriculture,Machine learning,Random Forest,Standardized Precipitation Index,Water resource management"

In Brazil soybean yield data generally demand various revisions through the following months after harvest suggesting that there is space for improving the accuracy and the time of yield predictions. This study presents a novel model to perform in-season (“near real-time”) soybean yield forecasts in southern Brazil using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Networks, satellite imagery and weather data. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the performance of three different algorithms (multivariate OLS linear regression, random forest and LSTM neural networks) for forecasting soybean yield using NDVI, EVI, land surface temperature and precipitation as independent variables, and (ii) evaluate how early (during the soybean growing season) this method is able to forecast yield with reasonable accuracy. Satellite and weather data were masked using a non-crop-specific layer with field boundaries obtained from the Rural Environment Registry that is mandatory for all farmers in Brazil. Main outcomes from this study were: (i) soybean yield forecasts at municipality-scale with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 Mg ha−1 at DOY 64 (march 5) (ii) a superior performance of the LSTM neural networks relative to the other algorithms for all the forecast dates except DOY 16 where multivariate OLS linear regression provided the best performance, and (iii) model performance (e.g., MAE) for yield forecast decreased when predictions were performed earlier in the season, with MAE increasing from 0.24 Mg ha−1 to 0.42 Mg ha−1 (last values from OLS regression) when forecast timing changed from DOY 64 (March 5) to DOY 16 (January 6).

Thus, the objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the influence of climatic elements on cotton yield in Brazil, 2) to predict cotton yield using machine learning algorithms based on climatic elements, 3) to calibrate and test machine learning models to forecast cotton yield based on climate data, and 4) to interpolate the estimated cotton yield of the most accurate model. The cotton yield forecast as a function of climatic elements was performed using machine learning algorithms with four parameters adjusted by ordinary least squares. The models show that cotton yield has a sigmoid trend due to the accumulation of P, PET, STO, and EXC during the cycle. It is possible to forecast cotton yield for the main producing regions of Brazil using Machine learning algorithms. Extra-trees regressor models performed better in forecasting cotton yield using climatic data from planting to flowering. Therefore, it is possible to have average anticipation of around 80 days, allowing the producer time to plan his activities such as harvest and sales strategies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artificial intelligence,bigdata,cop modelling,deep learning,random forest,water balance"
23,SCOPUS_ID:85091127328,"With agriculture rapidly becoming a data-driven field, it is imperative to extract useful information from large data collections to optimize the production systems. We compared the efficacy of regression (linear regression or generalized linear regression [GLR] for continuous or categorical outcomes, respectively), random forests (RF) and multilayer neural networks (NN) to predict beef carcass weight (CW), age when finished (AS), fat deposition (FD), and carcass quality (CQ). The data analyzed contained information on over 4 million beef cattle from 5,204 farms, corresponding to 4.3% of Brazil's national production between 2014 and 2016. Explanatory variables were integrated from different data sources and encompassed animal traits, participation in a technical advising program, nutritional products sold to farms, economic variables related to beef production, month when finished, soil fertility, and climate in the location in which animals were raised. The training set was composed of information collected in 2014 and 2015, while the testing set had information recorded in 2016. After parameter tuning for each algorithm, models were used to predict the testing set. The best model to predict CW and AS was RF (CW: Predicted root mean square error = 0.65, R2 = 0.61, and mean absolute error = 0.49; AS: Accuracy = 28.7%, Cohen's kappa coefficient [Kappa] = 0.08). While the best approach for FD and CQ was GLR (accuracy = 45.7%, Kappa = 0.05, and accuracy = 58.7%, Kappa = 0.09, respectively). Across all models, there was a tendency for better performance with RF and regression and worse with NN. Animal category, nutritional plan, cattle sales price, participation in a technical advising program, and climate and soil in which animals were raised were deemed important for prediction of meat production and quality with regression and RF. The development of strategies for prediction of livestock production using real-world large-scale data will be core to projecting future trends and optimizing the allocation of resources at all levels of the production chain, rendering animal production more sustainable. Despite beef cattle production being a complex system, this analysis shows that by integrating different sources of data it is possible to forecast meat production and quality at the national level with moderate-high levels of accuracy. © The Author(s) 2020.","Beef,Brazil,Forecasting,Large scale data,Machine learning"

However, there are still very few works on this subject under tropical conditions. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to use pXRF data to characterize the Brazilian Coastal Plains (BCP) soils and assess four machine learning algorithms [ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression (CR), XGBoost (XGB), and random forest (RF)] for prediction of total nitrogen (TN), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil organic matter (SOM) using pXRF data. A total of 285 soil samples were collected from the A and B horizons representing Ultisols, Oxisols, Spodosols, and Entisols. The pXRF reported elements helped in the characterization of the BCP soils. In general, the RF model achieved the best performances for TN (R2 = 0.50), CEC (0.75), and SOM (0.56) when A and B horizons were combined, although better results have been reported in the literature for soils from other regions of the world.

The evapotranspiration represents, in practice, the consumption of water by a culture and the quantitative information of this parameter assists in a large number of water management problems. By employing spatial interpolation methods, one can determine evapotranspiration in places where there is no information of this parameter. This work evaluates algorithms for spatial interpolation of evapotranspiration data in terms of precision and performance. It compares conventional strategies as the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK), and machine learning strategies, represented by the Random Forest (RF) and a Random Forest variation for spatial predictions (RFsp). The evaluation uses data of evapotranspiration from automatic meteorological stations located in the northeast region of Brazil, in January 2017. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to compare the precision of each interpolation algorithm. The results showed that RF obtained better results for the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration than conventional approaches, coming to reduce to roughly half the error obtained. Despite to resolve blocky artifacts present in RF spatial distribution, RFsp did not present better results than RF, obtaining a very similar performance to IDW and OK. Concerning computational performance, IDW obtained the shortest time to create the interpolation model.

26,SCOPUS_ID:85073429951,"In the last decades, eucalypt plantations are expanding across the Brazilian savanna, one of the most frequently burned ecosystems in the world. Wildfires are one of the main threats to forest plantations, causing economic and environmental loss. Modeling wildfire occurrence provides a better understanding of the processes that drive fire activity. Furthermore, the use of spatially explicit models may promote more effective management strategies and support fire prevention policies. In this work, we assessed wildfire occurrence combining Random Forest (RF) algorithms and cluster analysis to predict and detect changes in the spatial pattern of ignition probability over time. The model was trained using several explanatory drivers related to fire ignition: accessibility, proximity to agricultural lands or human activities, among others. Specifically, we introduced the progression of eucalypt plantations on a two-year basis to capture the influence of land cover changes over fire likelihood consistently. Fire occurrences in the period 2010-2016 were retrieved from the Brazilian Institute of Space Research (INPE) database. In terms of the AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), the model denoted fairly good predictive accuracy (AUC ≈ 0.72). Results suggested that fire occurrence was mainly linked to proximity agricultural and to urban interfaces. Eucalypt plantation contributed to increased wildfire likelihood and denoted fairly high importance as an explanatory variable (17% increase of Mean Square Error [MSE]). Nevertheless, agriculture and urban interfaces proved to be the main drivers, contributing to decreasing the RF's MSE in 42% and 38%, respectively. Furthermore, eucalypt plantations expansion is progressing over clusters of high wildfire likelihood, thus increasing the exposure to wildfire events for young eucalypt plantations and nearby areas. Protective measures should be focus on in the mapped Hot Spot zones in order to mitigate the exposure to fire events and to contribute for an efficient initial suppression rather than costly firefighting. © 2019 by the authors.

27,SCOPUS_ID:85044256964,"Examples of large-scale restoration programs to recover ecosystem services are now common in many countries, and governments are assuming ambitious forest restoration targets. Given the increasing investment of time, effort, and money in restoration, there is an urgent need to develop monitoring programs to assess restoration effectiveness. Some countries are already conducting monitoring programs, but the effectiveness of the restoration programs remains mostly unknown. Restoration evaluation often entails significant difficulties, such as the lack of harmonized monitoring data and imprecise information available about project goals and implementation. With the intent of contributing to the development of effective and accountable restoration projects, the objective of our work is to create a conceptual model that provides the building blocks of a planning and monitoring system to support forest restoration programs. The aim is to develop a conceptual model that represents forest restoration monitoring processes that effectively attain and measure the desirable outcomes. The São Paulo Forest Restoration Program is the case study that provides variables and processes to illustrate the development of the conceptual model. This paper presents the conceptual model, emphasizing generalizable principles that extend its applicability to similar monitoring programs. Based on action learning principles and recommendations from a comprehensive literature review, the resulting Forest Management Decisions Support System (FMDSS) embeds adaptive management strategies and the existence of an auto-updatable knowledge base. The result is a conceptual model that can be generalizable and applicable beyond the realms of the FMDSS. The restoration of degraded areas in a case with >40,000 rural properties serves as the case study. Although the planning and the monitoring of the restoration programs differ, the generalizable principles used to develop the conceptual model presented in this paper result in continuous intelligent monitoring processes that transform the systems so that they are adaptable to apparently different situations. Additionally, conceptual models that integrate adaptive planning and monitoring processes, supported by an auto-updatable knowledge base, mitigate the risk of failures, mainly when the comprehensive gathering of well-established references for the initial knowledge base has been conducted well at the outset. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive management,Forest management decision support system,Forest restoration,Integrated forest planning"

29,SCOPUS_ID:85054060337,"Historically, the expansion of soy plantations has been a major driver of land-use/cover change (LUCC) in Brazil. While a series of recent public actions and supply-chain commitments reportedly curbed the replacement of forests by soy, the expansion of the agricultural commodity still poses a considerable threat to the Amazonian and Cerrado biomes. Identification of areas under high risk of soy expansion is thus paramount to assist conservation efforts in the region. We mapped the areas suitable for undergoing transition to soy plantations in the Legal Amazon with a machine-learning approach adopted from the ecological modeling literature. Simulated soy expansion for the year 2014 exhibited favorable validation scores compared to other LUCC models. We then used our model to simulate how potential future infrastructure improvements would affect the 2014 probabilities of soy occurrence in the region. In addition to the 2.3 Mha of planted soy in the Legal Amazon in 2014, our model identified another 14.7 Mha with high probability of soy conversion in the region given the infrastructure conditions at that time. Out of those, pastures and forests represented 9.8 and 0.4 Mha, respectively. Under the new infrastructure scenarios simulated, the Legal Amazonian area under high risk of soy conversion increased by up to 2.1 Mha (14.6%). These changes led to up to 11.4 and 51.4% increases in the high-risk of conversion areas of pastures and forests, respectively. If conversion occurs in the identified high-risk areas, at least 4.8 Pg of CO2 could be released into the atmosphere, a value that represents 10 times the total CO2 emissions of Brazil in 2014.

In particular, Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive to obtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits.

Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artificial neural networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive models.

32,SCOPUS_ID:85033360591,"As the world’s population grows to a projected 11.2 billion by 2100, the number of people living in low-lying areas exposed to coastal hazards is projected to increase. Critical infrastructure and valuable assets continue to be placed in vulnerable areas, and in recent years, millions of people have been displaced by natural hazards. Impacts from coastal hazards depend on the number of people, value of assets, and presence of critical resources in harm’s way. Risks related to natural hazards are determined by a complex interaction between physical hazards, the vulnerability of a society or social-ecological system and its exposure to such hazards. Moreover, these risks are amplified by challenging socioeconomic dynamics, including poorly planned urban development, income inequality, and poverty. This study employs a combination of machine learning clustering techniques (Self Organizing Maps and K-Means) and a spatial index, to assess coastal risks in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) on a comparative scale. The proposed method meets multiple objectives, including the identification of hotspots and key drivers of coastal risk, and the ability to process large-volume multidimensional and multivariate datasets, effectively reducing sixteen variables related to coastal hazards, geographic exposure, and socioeconomic vulnerability, into a single index. Our results demonstrate that in LAC, more than 500,000 people live in areas where coastal hazards, exposure (of people, assets and ecosystems) and poverty converge, creating the ideal conditions for a perfect storm. Hotspot locations of coastal risk, identified by the proposed Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI), contain more than 300,00 people and include: El Oro, Ecuador; Sinaloa, Mexico; Usulutan, El Salvador; and Chiapas, Mexico. Our results provide important insights into potential adaptation alternatives that could reduce the impacts of future hazards. Effective adaptation options must not only focus on developing coastal defenses, but also on improving practices and policies related to urban development, agricultural land use, and conservation, as well as ameliorating socioeconomic conditions. © 2017 Calil et al.

33,SCOPUS_ID:85020285344,"History matching is the process of modifying the uncertain attributes of a reservoir model to reproduce the real reservoir performance. It is a classical reservoir engineering problem and plays an important role in reservoir management since the resulting models are used to support decisions in other tasks such as economic analysis and production strategy. This work introduces a dynamic decision-making optimization framework for history matching problems in which new models are generated based on, and guided by, the dynamic analysis of the data of available solutions. The optimization framework follows a learning-from-data' approach, and includes two optimizer components that use machine learning techniques, such as unsupervised learning and statistical analysis, to uncover patterns of input attributes that lead to good output responses. These patterns are used to support the decision-making process while generating new, and better, history matched solutions. The proposed framework is applied to a benchmark model (UNISIM-I-H) based on the Namorado field in Brazil. Results show the potential the dynamic decision-making optimization framework has for improving the quality of history matching solutions using a substantial smaller number of simulations when compared with a previous work on the same benchmark. © 2017 Cavalcante et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

In the present study, we have developed different indices to assess the availability of water using an IWRM approach. These indices evaluate supply to demands, surface availability, groundwater availability, reservoirs, and environmental flow. Moreover, reliability, resilience, and vulnerability were determined. Sustainability index (SI) and sustainability index by groups (SG) were determined based on the five indices (all indices vary from 0 to 1). The impacts of climate change affect surface and groundwater availability, as do the agricultural, urban, and industrial requirements on the different supplies. We used the generalized AQUATOOL Decision Support System Shell (DSSS) to evaluate the IWRM in the Rio Grande Basin (Morelia, México). Various emission scenarios from representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were applied to the basin for the years 2015-2039 and 2075-2099. The results indicate increases in agricultural and urban demand, and decreases in surface runoff, as well as groundwater recharge. The proposed indices are useful for different approaches (decision-makers, water policy, and drought risks, among others). CC significantly affects the different proposed indices and indicates a decrease of the SI, SG1, and SG2 (i.e., less availability). For example, we found that SG2 decreased from 0.812 to 0.195 under the RCP 8.5 2075-2099 scenario, and SG2 equal to 0.252 and 0.326 for the RCP 6.0 2075-2099 and RCP 4.5 2070-2099 scenarios, respectively (values close to 0 indicate worst drought conditions). © 2017 by the authors.

Crops under this production system are highly affected by the inherent annual and intra-seasonal weather variability, especially dry spells, that affect productivity. One of the simplest strategies with virtually no cost to mitigate this problem is the determination of a sowing window that minimizes the negative effects of weather variability on rainfed agriculture. The objectives of this study were to: a) use the results of maize yield simulated with a process-based model to establish sowing windows and, b) compare our results with the current methodology employed by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA). The CSM-CERES-Maize model of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate scenarios of weekly sowing dates, under rainfed conditions, for selected counties of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. For each sowing date it was determined the yield break by comparing the average yield of the current sowing date with the highest average yield obtained from all sowing dates. Thus, each sowing date was associated with a risk of yield loss. The use of simulated yield break data to establish sowing windows produced consistent results. The sowing windows obtained from the simulations were slightly different from those proposed by MAPA. The use of process-based models to simulate crop yield allows for the integration of many factors not considered in the current crop zoning approach used by MAPA. The proposed approach has advantages over the MAPA methodology in that it includes the possibility of determining the expected average yield and its amplitude.","Climate risk,DSSAT,Modeling,Sowing window,Zea mays L."
