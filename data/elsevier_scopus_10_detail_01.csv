0,SCOPUS_ID:85111860569,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on Brazil. Brazil’s social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically. We consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics. The XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95% CI 0.810–0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors. In conclusion, socioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization. © 2021, The Author(s).",
1,SCOPUS_ID:85103010291,"Smallholder farmers are amongst the most vulnerable communities in developing countries, lacking a stable income due to inconsistent access to markets. Aiming to tackle rural poverty, the Brazilian government established institutional markets for smallholder farmers to supply their produce to schools through a non-competitive bidding mechanism. However, participation of farmers is still limited due to the challenging decision-making process. Aspiring to contribute towards increasing their participation, this study aims to support farmers into two key decisions they face during sequential stages of the bidding process, namely whether to bid for each available school and product combination and whether subsequently to accept the awarded bids once the bids’ outcome is known. A decision support system, based on two sequential MILP optimisation models, was developed and applied to the case study of Canudos settlement, guiding farmers on the optimal bidding and contract acceptance strategy. This study contributes to the decision support systems field by applying OR methods to a real-life problem within a new context. It is the first application of an OR-based decision support system in the non-competitive bid/no-bid literature, defining an optimal bidding strategy through the application of optimisation methods to maximise profitability while removing subjectivity from the decision-making process. Moreover, it is the first decision support system within the bid/no-bid decision-making field being applied to the agricultural and institutional market context. The proposed approach could have a significant social impact for smallholder farmers in Brazil, improving their living conditions by providing security of income and strengthening inclusive agricultural growth. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bidding,Decision support systems,OR in agriculture,OR in developing countries,Smallholder farmers"
2,SCOPUS_ID:85116428769,"Crime is one of the most severe social problems in developed and emerging countries, and it affects welfare, economy, and regional development. The study of criminal behavior is significant to the formulation of new law enforcement strategies for crime prevention and control. In addition, some governments have implemented projects in a smart cities context to make available some databases related to various phenomena that occur inside their cities, including those associated with criminal acts. Medellin, Colombia, has several public databases where it is possible to get information about mobility, education, infrastructure, health, and security. In this work, some Machine Learning models are developed and evaluated for crime hotspots prediction using available geographical, temporal and demographic information available in Medellin for a period between 2015 and 2019. The work analyzes the implications of selecting geographic divisions and the separation of time intervals in the models. As a result, it was found that the models based on Decision Trees present an F1-Score of 88.2 % and have better performance than models based on Logistic Regression and Neural Networks (MLP). © 2021 IEEE.","crime hotspots,Crime prediction,machine learning,predictive models"
3,SCOPUS_ID:85112764575,"This passage gave an analyse big data collected from UNESCO and report from governments then give health index to countries and focus on Brazil to give some possible solutions to the problem. First, we aim to develop EHSIS model to assess the health of any national higher education system. We define the weight of the indexes by subjective weighting and objective weighting by using Analytic Hierarchy Process and Principal Component Analysis (AHP) to compare the importance of different weight and Entropy Method to get the weight from comparing the degree of dispersion of indicators. Then combine the weight and the normalized data to get the model to give scores to sample countries relying on the eight indexes. Then, we screened out several indicators with greater influence through Principal Component Analysis and correlation analysis of factors and extracted the recommended adjustable indicators to 3. We found that the proportion of foreign students has the greatest impact on the health and sustainability of higher education in the country, and it has a high correlation with QS excellent schools and UN News excellent schools, which are difficult to control. Other indicators that have a greater impact include the teacher-student ratio, employment rate, etc. Last, we forecast the changes of indexes without the policy by Grey prediction and use the memory-less of Markov Chain to predict the change after introducing new policies. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our policy, we utilize EHSIS model to give the score and compare the score with and without the policy and find a significant increase in score. What's more, we discuss the real-world influence and the hardness of achieving the goal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The data of the academic process from the first semester will be used in this proposal, considering that it is very important for an Institution to know previously the possible academic performance of its students and reduce their desertion. That is to say, good or bad academic performance in the first semester at the institution, which will subsequently redound in future semesters. The prediction will help us to project strategies that together with the institution, teachers, students, and parents can improve their activities of the teaching-learning process. To achieve the purpose of prediction, Machine Learning will be used, specifically, classification techniques to design a predictive model that allows to determine the academic performance of students and reduce their desertion, likewise to determine the best predictive algorithm. © 2021 AISTI.","academic performance,classification algorithms,higher technological level,Machine learning,student dropouts"
5,SCOPUS_ID:85106617575,"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a great impact on mental health in society. Considering the little attention paid by scientific studies to either students or university staff during lockdown, the current study has two aims: (a) to analyze the evolution of mental health and (b) to identify predictors of educational/professional experience and online learning/teaching expe-rience. (2) Methods: 1084 university students and 554 staff in total from four different countries (Spain, Colombia, Chile and Nicaragua) participated in the study, affiliated with nine different uni-versities, four of them Spanish and one of which was online. We used an online survey known as LockedDown, which consists of 82 items, analyzed with classical multiple regression analyses and machine learning techniques. (3) Results: Stress level and feelings of anxiety and depression of students and staff either increased or remained over the weeks. A better online learning experience for university students was associated with the age, perception of the experience as beneficial and support of the university. (4) Conclusions: The study has shown evidence of the emotional impact and quality of life for both students and staff. For students, the evolution of feelings of anxiety and de-pression, as well as the support offered by the university affected the educational experience and online learning. For staff who experienced a positive professional experience, with access to services and products, the quality-of-life levels were maintained. © 2021 by the authors.

6,SCOPUS_ID:85114197279,"Currently the high rates of university dropouts and low graduation are social problems that are very relevant in Chilean society. Predicting these events can allow institutions to take action to avoid them. The typical prediction models based on machine learning are capable of making reliable predictions, however they do not allow to understand the causality that originates both events, which could help to take better actions. This work proposes to find, analyze and weigh the causal relationships that allow predicting whether a student will drop out or will graduate according to the information available using a framework with Bayesian networks. The study is based on real data from the Universidad Católica de Temuco in Chile collected over three years. The results reveal variables and relevant relationships according the opinion of human experts, which suggest that the proposed model provides better capabilities to represent the causality of university dropout and graduation. From the results we believe that it is feasible to design better retention policies and timely degree at a university. © 2021 IEEE.","Bayesian networks,Desertion,Education,Graduation"

12,SCOPUS_ID:85104833944,"It is well known that bullying is a public health issue and that it has negative consequences for students who are involved in this dynamic phenomenon. Recent government reports have shown that a total of 39 315 reported cases of bullying incidents have been reported between 2013 and 2020 in Peru, where most of the cases were physical forms and occurred in public schools. Research has shown that teachers play a critical role in bullying incidents and may influence bullying situations through functional or non-functional strategies. However, research on elementary Peruvian teachers is scarce. Therefore, the present research aimed to explore elementary Peruvian teachers and their strategies for managing physical bullying situations in relation to victims and bystanders. Results showed that teacher strategies vary when approaching victims and bystanders.

15,SCOPUS_ID:85091665327,"Studies on frailty frequently only include older persons. The mapping of factors related to syndrome and negative outcomes associated with it, also in middle age, may assist in health strategies to each age group. The aim of this study was to investigate social and health factors related to the frailty phenotype and to analyze the probabilistic relationships between frailty, falls and hospitalization in middle-aged and older persons. This is a cross-sectional study using data of 4442 middle-aged (50–59 years) and older participants (60 years or older) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) 2015 and 2016. Bayesian network models were estimated with the score-based hill-climbing algorithm to identify factors associated with frailty, falls and hospitalization. Mean age was 63.75 years, and prevalence of frailty was 8.5 % and 11.9 % among middle-aged and older participants, respectively. In the former, the probability of frailty increased when “poor” self-rated memory was considered in the model; and in the latter, the probability of frailty was greatest among individuals who did not participate socially and had the lowest level of education. In both age groups, frailty was an important factor that influenced the probability of negative health outcomes such as falls and hospitalization. However, this result depended on combinations of health factors in each sample. This study has identified potential vulnerabilities that should be considered when undertaking a comprehensive assessment of middle-aged and older persons and developing suitable health strategies for each of these phases of life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian networks,Frailty,Outcomes,Probabilistic inference,Risk factors"
16,SCOPUS_ID:85111067759,"This paper offers a methodology to improve targeting design and assessment when two or more groups need to be considered, and trade-offs exist between using different targeting mechanisms. The paper builds from the multidimensional targeting challenge facing conditional cash transfers (CCTs). I analyze whether a common CCT targeting mechanism, namely, a proxy means test (PMT), can identify the poor and future school dropouts effectively. Despite both being key target groups for CCTs, students at risk of dropping out are rarely considered for CCT allocation or in targeting assessments. Using rich administrative data sets from Chile to simulate different targeting mechanisms, I compare the targeting effectiveness of a PMT and other mechanisms based on a predictive model of school dropout. I build this model using machine learning algorithms. Using two novel metrics, I show that combining the outputs of the predictive model with the PMT increases targeting effectiveness except when the social valuation of the poor and future school dropouts differs to a large extent. More generally, public officials who value their key target groups equally may improve policy targeting by modifying their allocation procedures. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

18,SCOPUS_ID:85093520440,"Cybersafety has been a mainstay of digital education since computers arrived in classrooms in the mid 1990s. Whether schools encourage students to be ""cybersmart"" (Australia), ""netsafe"" (New Zealand) or to be aware of ""cybersecurity strategies"" (Mexico and Chile) most now devote a relatively large amount of time and money to teaching young people how to ""stay safe"" online. In this article, we argue that it is time for schools to move beyond the cybersafety discourse to encourage students to think more critically about the digital media they use. Reporting on the digital practices of 276 pre-teens aged 7-12 years in Australia and Uruguay, we contend that the everyday digital challenges young people face are now beyond the scope of most cybersafety programs. Our findings highlight that many of the issues preteens are negotiating call for more nuanced and sustained educational programs that support the development of critical social media literacies. In particular, with the proliferation of mass user platforms and artificial intelligence, there is a need for schools to educate students around managing and protecting their personal data.

19,SCOPUS_ID:85086805577,"This study aimed to understand the perception of drought among farmers, in order to support decision-making in the water allocation process. This study was carried out in the Tabuleiro de Russas irrigated perimeter, in northeast Brazil, over the drought period of 2012-2018. Two analyses were conducted: (i) drought characterization, using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on drought duration and frequency criteria; and (ii) analysis of farmers' perceptions of drought via selection of explanatory variables using the Random Forest (RF) and the Decision Tree (DT) methods. The 2012-2018 drought period was defined as a meteorological phenomenon by local farmers; however, an SPI evaluation indicated that the drought was of a hydrological nature. According to the RF analysis, four of the nine study variables were more statistically important than the others in influencing farmers' perception of drought: number of cultivated land plots, farmer's age, years of experience in the agriculture sector, and education level. These results were confirmed using DT analysis. Understanding the relationship between these variables and farmers' perception of drought could aid in the development of an adaptation strategy to water deficit scenarios. Farmers' perception can be beneficial in reducing conflicts, adopting proactive management practices, and developing a holistic and efficient early warning drought system. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision Tree,Drought perception,Irrigated agriculture,Machine learning,Random Forest,Standardized Precipitation Index,Water resource management"

28,SCOPUS_ID:85063425360,"Digital Transformation Inside Universities, a dual approach: On the way to the IV Industry Revolution companies of all kinds, are focused on the massive and optimal use of ICT in different organizational plans including human talent, organizational structures, processes, inputs, products, services and obviously the business model. Nowadays, 70% of the top companies have robust digital transformation (DT) teams, and 40% of them are being driven by high ICT and Artificial and Computational Intelligence. In other hand, very few Colombian universities have tackled the problem of competitiveness in higher education (HE), much less they have made the transition to the IV Industrial Revolution by taking the leap, thus receiving a tremendous blow due to academic obsolescence. In the recent ANDICOM (ICT International Congress, numerous national cases of domestic DT were presented from companies, but, unfortunately, not a single case of HE. Will the case of computerization in Colombia, be replicated, which was left to the discretion of transnational computer elites? The University DT implies necessarily the cognimatics (the informatics for the Knowledge Society) of all the companies, and their social insertion in this country. Why University Architecture: Enterprise Architecture (EA): Architecting implies the organization of subsystems or components to obtain better and/or new functionalities. If any component is knowledge-based, an intelligent behavior is obtained. The architecture-multilayer approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, that ensures compliance with government policies, rules and standards, in a highly complex social institution with intellectual assets and knowledge processes, which is a usual situation in a university institution; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is made-up, and with the protocols by which they communicate. EA and Business Architecture constitute a conceptual tool that helps the organizations to understand their own structure and the approach by which they work. It provides a business 360° vision map, and planning frame for business and technological changes. EA is presented like a system overall configuration of subsystems or components organized in layers, where each one describes an ordered congregation of structures and common functionalities grouped by a purposeful criterion inside the business. Our Proposal: We present a succinct outline of our architectural dual model (data-knowledge), of the digital university transformation. It is a dual DT model: curricular digitalization and institutional digitalization, i.e. knowledge and data. The pillars of the architecture are Funding, Research, Entrepreneurship and Social Projection, recognizing from the start, that Knowledge has its ethos in the University; they correspond to: 1-Productive Ecosystem of the transformation. 2-DT that enhance the knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capacities. 3-A new economy that requires transformation, also supported on entrepreneurship. 4-New DT human talent required by the new industry of knowledge and intelligence. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required. We discuss the basic, conceptual aspects, and methodology for the DT, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years leading the DT in Postsecondary Education (PSEd) © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence,Digital Talent,Digital Transformation,DT Ecosystem,DT Methodology,Fuzzy Dashboard Matrix,ICT,Postsecondary Education"

30,SCOPUS_ID:85079165092,"The aerospace industry has two industrial subsectors: Aeronautics and Space. The leading countries in this global value chain (GVC) present a holistic perception of this indissoluble binomial. However, there are learner countries which have been integrated in an unprecedented way into Aeronautics. Therefore, this paradigm break is the reason why this investigation was conducted. The “technological capability” concept builds an architecture that fully supports the relation between technological and governance development in Politics, Commerce and Society. Therefore, on this research, a theoretical approach of Science and Technology in the field of Social Sciences and International Relations was developed with the purpose of generating an adequate analysis framework based on the Governance Theory, Open Innovation and Technological Capabilities literature. This framework served to analyze three case studies, such as Brazil, Canada and China. As intermediate industrial leaders in the manufacture of regional aircraft, despite having a different technological trajectory, their technical capabilities impacted on the GVC, thus generating a new governance in local institutions and international organizations. In these three cases, not only favorable conditions have emerged, but also, they faced a poor management regarding public policies. As a result, it was found that this atmosphere is called as a National Innovation System (NIS) and it is a methodological turning point to analyze the technological transfer, adoption and assimilation in developing countries, which could lead to finished products for the space sector. In the three case studies, the main interest was a military, political and industrial integration. However, considering the Industry 4.0 and a global technological convergence, it is concluded that the aerospace industry has become a multicausal and multisectoral phenomenon when integrating new advanced functionalities such as Blockchain, Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Analytics. This technological enablement has led to industry good practices in Aeronautics regarding discrete manufacturing and B2B2C services; as for the space sector concerning Remote Sensing for disaster management, public health, communications and climate change studies. All the previous based on an open innovation economy, which is nourished not only by an inter-business dynamic, but also by external data sources. Now the challenges of this reformulation will revolve around integration, global standards, systems interoperability and data security (GDPR). The NIS will then have to be able to manage these factors to achieve both commercial competitiveness and the guarantee of a social benefit.

31,SCOPUS_ID:85071469571,"In Colombia, the desertion average rate shows that only around half of the students that begin an undergraduate program are finishing their studies. Although several models have been developed, the results of the implementation of strategies for student retention have not been sufficiently effective. Therefore, this study focuses on the creation of robust predictive models that allow timely anticipation of the risk that an engineering student will retire prematurely from the program. This phenomenon is analyzed in an empirical way through a methodology of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) using different machine learning techniques. Results show that the academic cost (in terms of the number of subjects viewed) and the semester the student entered have a significant impact on the probability of dropout occurring, especially when considering the dropout in the firsts semester. Then, acting on the students predicted by the model might reduce the number of dropouts. Copyright © 2019 Andrés Acero, Juan Camilo Achury and Juan Carlos Morales.",

This program uses the conceptual change approach as a framework in a recursive way, and it is specially designed to promote and ensure the use of active and innovative methodologies. The development program consists of six steps that aim to strengthen a learning community that fosters interaction of professors with common problems, interests, and experiences in a way that the collegial work sustains over time the dynamic and improved incorporation of active methodologies for teaching and learning. For this paper, we focus on the structure and some results. The results are related to faculty, students and institutional perceptions. We have evidence that faculty in this program changes their own perceptions as instructors towards reflecting whether their role is less regarding to transmitting knowledge, notes, and presentations to students. In the case of students, after a survey in courses in which participants were implementing educational strategies from the program, students’ view is positive towards the activities.

33,SCOPUS_ID:85085665658,"Although it has one of the largest integrated power generation, transmission and distribution systems in the world, Brazil still faces difficulties in consolidating the various technologies that make up Smart Grids solutions and in executing large projects in the sector, especially in distribution management. Currently, some utilities have pilot projects in operation in a small number of cities, but these projects face several obstacles in the technical, economic, political and legal areas. This study analyses the receptivity to the Smart Grid technologies in the Brazilian electric sector context, by the application of a framework that allows: (i) to identify the obstacles to the implementation of Smart Grid projects and (ii) to propose recommendations for innovation policies. Considering that the Smart Grids solution are composed by a wide gamma of technologies, thus study initially examined the whole smart grid solution, and then focused on an important technology: Advanced Distribution Management Software (ADMS). The chosen framework adopts the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) concept, that maps the functional pattern of a TIS, allowing the evaluation of its development stage through the identification of the strategic points relevant to its growth. As a final product of the application of the framework, policy recommendations can be proposed to foster the development of research, projects, formation of national companies, implementation and diffusion of knowledge of smart grids technologies in Brazil. Many blocking mechanisms to be faced were identified, such as obsolete regulation contracts; unfavorable tributary environment; bottlenecks in the R&D network formation; high macroeconomic instability in the last years, causing uncertainty and increasing the risk perception; high cost of the smart grids solutions and ADMS, specifically, and lack of good results on smart grid researches. To leverage smart grid projects, the policy recommendations include, among others: specific short-term actions, firstly conferring a new model of regulation of the electric system that allows distributors to make investments. In the medium term, it is necessary to perform a reform of taxes and the way in which services and software licenses are imported. In the long term it is necessary to invest in education and research, stimulating the partnership between agencies, companies, universities, institutes and research centers. The strengthening of this network is fundamental for the development of R&D in Brazil. As a conclusion of this research, it can be said that Brazil has a weak functional pattern combined with specific blocking mechanisms that weaken the Technological System and hamper the development and implementation of Smart Grids technologies. © 2018 Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018.

These processes are associated with increased dust exposure, which might affect children’s respiratory health. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the causal attributable risk of living close to the mines on asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis risk burden in children. Data on the prevalence of respiratory diseases and potential confounders were available from a cross-sectional survey carried out in 2009 among 288 (response: 69%) children living in the community. The proximity of the children’s home addresses to the local gold and copper mine was calculated using geographical positioning systems. We applied targeted maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the causal attributable risk (CAR) for asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and both outcomes combined. Children living more than the first quartile away from the mines were used as the unexposed group. Based on the estimated CAR, a hypothetical intervention in which all children lived at least one quartile away from the copper mine would decrease the risk of rhinoconjunctivitis by 4.7 percentage points (CAR: –4.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): –8.4; –0.11); and 4.2 percentage points (CAR: –4.2; 95% CI: –7.9;–0.05) for both outcomes combined. Overall, our results suggest that a hypothetical intervention intended to increase the distance between the place of residence of the highest exposed children would reduce the prevalence of respiratory disease in the community by around four percentage points. This approach could help local policymakers in the development of efficient public health strategies. © 2017 by the authors.

38,SCOPUS_ID:85030561930,"There is a significant need for improvement in undergraduate science and engineering education; accordingly, the same applies for effective professional development for teachers of engineering in Latin America. The need for a change from a teacher-centered to a studentcentered education is becoming an urgent issue. In particular, Chile is investing in funded projects to improve the preparation of future engineers in the country. This work presents preliminary results of an ongoing program of teacher preparation for engineering faculty in a large private university in Chile. The first stage of the project uses Walter and Kautz's (2015) framework to prepare a semester-long program consisting of five workshops (48 hours long) for 20 faculty members. Using a conceptual change approach, the focus of each workshop is the following: 1) Raising awareness within the faculty of the need of active learning to prepare the new generations of students; 2) Introduction to collaborative and active learning strategies; 3) Inquiry-based education; 4) Aligning teaching and assessment; 5) Difficulties on implementing active learning. Each session was designed to emulate active learning dynamics. After each workshop, participants designed and documented the implementation of activities and read various articles related to the workshop topics. The data collected consists of responses to the Approaches to Teaching Inventory (ATI) by two groups of professors. One group consisted of 76 full time professors of the School of Engineering in which the study was conducted. The other group consisted of a subset of 20 faculty members. Some of the faculty members had previous experience in teacher preparation programs that addressed general education strategies, while others had no experience at all with these strategies. Participants responded the ATI at the beginning of the two-day workshop (first group that includes the second one) and at the end of the workshop sequence (second group of faculty only). This paper analyzes the ways in which teachers changed their perspective regarding teaching engineering and their prior teacher preparation. The results showed that for the majority of the faculty members in the program, some who had previous experience and those who did not have any experience, the implementation of active learning and collaborative learning was different from what they previously thought it was. Their perspective of the teaching practice changed, not only by the activities they carried out in the workshops, but also by the activities they designed and implemented in their own classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",

44,SCOPUS_ID:84879986594,"Throughout Chile's history, mining has consistently been a leading industry in the country. The 1990s marked the beginning of a boom in Chile's mining industry, especially in copper mining, due to both foreign and local direct investment in the sector. Mining's contribution to the GDP was 15.6% at current prices in 2009, and it accounts for 56% of the country's exports. Chile's copper market share reached 35% in 2009. The investment portfolio in mining in Chile for the coming decade has been estimated at 90 billion US dollars. The acute scarcity of human resources currently experienced by the mining sector in Chile will be accentuated in the coming decade as a result of this scenario of investments. The situation is, additionally, similar to the one confronted by other countries involved in the mining industry such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and in Latin America includes, Peru, Colombia and Brazil. A study carried out by Fundacion Chile, ̈Labor Force in the Chile Mining Industry, Diagnostic and Recommendations, 2011-2020"" shows the projected labor shortage for the operation of projects in the development stage, considering only the requirements of the process of extraction, processing, and maintenance. The demand, accumulated incrementally, will be around 115,000 technically skilled workers, professionals, and qualified workers. This figure refers to the operational work force, and does not include the human resources that will be required for the prior stage of the engineering and construction of the projects (brownfield and greenfield). The demand for technically skilled workers and professions for the stages of engineering and construction of the projects that have already received investments is estimated to be 190,000 people for the period 2012-2020. The peak of the demand for engineering is 2012, with a figure that surpasses the 12,000 professionals for all of the engineering specialties. The analysis of the formation of human resources at the tertiary level (where tertiary includes technical/vocational and academic degrees at the undergraduate level) for mining and related majors demonstrates that the programs are scarce with a bias toward theoretical contents and that they are excessively long (40% longer than comparable programs in Australia, Canada, and in OECD countries). The completion rates are low, especially in the technical-vocational programs, which have a completion rate of only around 30%. Finally, the rates of attraction of technically skilled labor and professionals towards careers in mining are insufficient to reduce the identified skill gaps. In the case of university professionals such as geologists, mining engineers and engineers in metallurgy, 80-90% will work in mining. In the case of graduates of relevant majors, that cover skills also utilized by other industries, not only mining-such as maintenance workers, operators of fixed and mobile equipment, etc.-the mining sector appears to be unattractive for reasons such as shift schedules, geographical location of work sites, and other factors.
